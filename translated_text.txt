Chapter 1
Entering the Xuan Miao Sect
On the quiet and steady path of Jingdu Mountain, the sunlight is warm and the scenery pleasant. Three figures walk side by side.
The tall young man on the far left reminded, “Ah Man, this isn’t home. If you continue to be spoiled and willful, no one will indulge you. Once you enter the Xuan Miao Sect, you must devote yourself to study. This is a hard-earned opportunity, and both Father and Big Brother are very pleased. Don’t act recklessly and ruin it.”
Gu Fuyou, with her arms crossed, retorted, “Pleased? Maybe they’re just relieved to be rid of me, the troublemaker.”
She grumbled impatiently, “Gu Huaiyou, I don’t want to join the Xuan Miao Sect.”
The sect is known for its strict rules.
Stepping out from the center, Gu Fuyou turned around and began walking backward, facing the other two, “You both definitely belong to the Xuan Miao Sect. But why should I? Just to be looked down upon?”
“You’re talking nonsense again,” said Gu Huaiyou. He has a naturally friendly face, which looks even more dignified due to the occasion. Dressed in a round-necked blue robe with his hair neatly tied up, his attractiveness is more pronounced.
“Don’t even think about causing trouble. If you mess up again, once we’re back in Xiaoyao City, I bet Uncle Gu will break your legs,” Si Miao said lazily, glancing at Gu Fuyou. Her tone cut short any further mischief from Gu.
Wearing a blue lotus-colored silk dress, Si Miao sports a jade hairpin in her hair, with sharp eyes, pronounced brows, and a striking face. Her only perceived imperfection might be her slender, sharp lips. It’s often believed that people with such lips can be rather stern. Gu Fuyou had been on the receiving end of Si Miao’s sharp wit for years.
Internally sighing, Gu Fuyou thought how perfect the two of them looked together. Why couldn’t they just let her go and be lovey-dovey with each other?
Though Gu Fuyou no longer voiced her complaints, she remained deeply unwilling.
Gu Huaiyou tried to reassure her, “Xuan Miao Sect is one of the few prestigious immortal sects. Cultivating here is beneficial in every way. Ah Man, you love arranging formations, right? The Elder Liu He in the sect is an expert in both ancient and modern formations. Under his guidance, you’ll surely make significant progress…”
Gu Fuyou had a bitter look on her face, not listening to a single word.
She had been half-coaxed and half-threatened into coming to the Xuan Miao Sect. Any initial excitement had long been overshadowed by her discomfort.
…
Jingdu Mountain is a famous spiritual mountain in the Southern Continent, with gentle slopes and lush vegetation.
The three had reached the midpoint of the mountain. Disciples seeking entry were scattered in pairs or small groups.
Gu Fuyou noticed a wisteria plant by the side of the road, its clusters of flowers drooping beautifully like a purple waterfall. As she admired it, a breeze ruffled the petals, reminiscent of purple feathers.
She looked up to see three people flying on swords towards the mountain entrance. The leading woman had flowing white robes that seemed like clouds and mist surrounding her body.
Gu Fuyou gazed at the sky, her eyes shining like rippling waves. She was extremely envious.
Flying on a sword seemed so carefree. It’s a pity her cultivation is still at the Qi Practicing stage. She wondered when she’d reach the foundation-building stage and be able to fly.
As Gu Fuyou was lost in thought watching the figure, she heard Gu Huaiyou say, “It’s Nanzhu Jun. It seems she’ll be overseeing the disciple initiation this year.”
Gu Fuyou casually asked, “Who is Nanzhu Jun?”
Gu Huaiyou responded, “The head disciple of the sect leader, Zhong Michu. ‘Nanzhu Jun’ is her literary name. If we join the sect, all disciples of our generation must address her as Senior Sister.” Filled with admiration, he continued, “She started Qi Practing cultivation at three, reached Foundation Building at five, underwent the Body Tempering stage at twenty, and now at ninety-eight, she’s already entered the Golden Core stage. She’s a once-in-a-lifetime prodigy of the Xuan Miao Sect. Such talent, when looked upon throughout the continents, is among the very best.”
There was genuine reverence in Gu Huaiyou’s voice.
Gu Fuyou expressed her doubt, “How come I’ve never heard of her?”
Gu Huaiyou explained, “She is humble and doesn’t like to show off. I heard she has never descended the mountain, so she’s not as famous as those disciples from great families. It’s normal that you don’t know her.”
He had the good fortune of meeting her once during a previous visit to Xuan Miao with their father.
Si Miao teasingly told Gu Fuyou, “Ah Man, she’s the definition of a true genius.”
Gu Huaiyou sincerely commented, “She has an unparalleled beauty, a noble status, and a gifted talent in cultivation. Such grace and elegance can be described as — flawless white jade.”
Gu Fuyou remarked, “Indeed, flawless white jade.”
With a teasing expression, Si Miao quipped, “Ouch, the sourness! How many years of aged vinegar is this?”
With her arms crossed, Gu Fuyou laughed, “I’m just jealous, so what?”
Gu Fuyou stared towards the mountain gate. The figures at the edge of the sky had already gone far, and she felt disappointed in her heart.
She deeply envied such innate talent, something she could never attain.
The sages said: The way of heaven is greatly benevolent, not biased or leaning.
But it was clear that the way of heaven had favored this senior sister.
Born into such different circumstances. Sigh.
Before long, the three arrived at the top of the mountain.
Despite her resistance, Gu Fuyou eventually stepped through the gates of Xuan Miao.
The disciples entering Xuan Miao Sect this time had already been chosen. Those present were all qualified.
They were here to register. After verifying their cultivation levels and getting their identification jade tablets, they could reside within the sect. The next day, they would be divided into classes based on their level and follow their teachers for lessons.
The main square was bustling. On the left, they were assessing cultivation levels and collecting documents, and on the right, they were registering and distributing jade tablets.
Gu Fuyou was at the very end of the line. She watched the people lined up neatly, handing over documents, receiving jade tablets, all in an orderly manner.
The sect had strict rules down to every word and gesture. Among the outstanding disciples present, she felt out of place, feeling frustrated to her core.
Why did she come here? To be mocked and ridiculed?
She pondered how she might make Xuan Miao reject her.
As she was scheming, someone joined the line behind her, examining her from head to toe.
“Who do I think it is? Third Gu, it really is you. What, are you here to send your second brother to join the sect?”
She turned to see who it was. Ah, the pioneer of mockery had arrived.
The man wore a black brocade robe, his slanted eyes full of mischief, and his brows arrogantly raised.
With a smirk, Gu Fuyou said, “Yuan Sheng, why do I keep running into you everywhere?”
Truly a twist of fate.
In noble households like theirs, it’s customary for young ladies and young masters who are close in age to be tutored together by a chosen teacher. Both of them once studied under the same teacher.
Until the teacher could no longer endure Gu Fuyou’s temperament and expelled her back home, frankly stating, “This humble scholar is incompetent and unable to undertake this great responsibility,” vowing to never teach Gu Fuyou again. The two of them had been classmates for several years.
After all these years, they now found themselves in the same sect.
Yuan Sheng, courtesy name Yuan Changsui. Among peers, it was deemed disrespectful to address someone directly by their given name. Since Yuan Changsui had called Gu Fuyou by a nickname, so Gu Fuyou reciprocated by calling him by his given name.
Yuan Changsui’s face darkened. The line had moved forward, and it was now Si Miao’s turn. Next was Gu Fuyou.
Yuan Changsui sneered, “I came to join Xuan Miao to cultivate, which is different from you. Given your qualifications, you probably won’t even make it into Xuan Miao in this lifetime.”
He gave Gu Fuyou a friendly pat on the shoulder and laughed, “Still, it’s good for you to explore a bit. Soak up the spiritual energy here, and who knows? Maybe in a decade, you’ll hit the Foundation Building stage.”
Gu Fuyou brushed off his arm, smiled faintly at him, and chose not to respond.
Smugly assuming she had no comeback, Yuan Changsui felt a surge of satisfaction. He’d always looked down on her since they were children. In his eyes, she lacked notable skills, was too arrogant, quirky, and only held her current position due to the influence of her father and brothers.
Back then, it wasn’t just him who considered her an oddity. All the students who learned with them despised and avoided her. Once there’s disdain, everything the person does seems wrong.
Every time their paths crossed, Yuan Changsui always sought to upset Gu Fuyou.
The more defiant and proud she acted, the more satisfaction Yuan Changsui derived from tormenting her, just like today.
It was now Gu Fuyou’s turn in line. Gu Huaiyou and Si Miao moved to another side to get their jade tablets. As they were leaving, they saw Yuan Changsui behind and sensed trouble.
The disciple guiding them was rushing them along, so Gu Huaiyou quickly greeted Yuan Changsui and reminded Gu Fuyou not to cause any trouble.
He wasn’t worried about Gu Fuyou being bullied by Yuan Changsui; he was afraid she might intentionally stir up trouble.
Yuan Changsui took a step to the left, intending to bypass Gu Fuyou and hand in his documents. However, Gu Fuyou also stepped to the side, blocking him, “Hey!”
Yuan Changsui raised an eyebrow, “What, not convinced?”
Gu Fuyou shook her head, “I think you’re right.”
She leisurely pulled out her documents, opening them in front of Yuan Changsui, “I should properly admire and absorb the spiritual energy here.”
Yuan Changsui frowned. When he saw the three characters “Gu Fuyou” on the documents, he was shocked. Only disciples selected by the Xuan Miao Sect had such documents. How could Gu Fuyou have one?
But the document in her hand couldn’t be fake.
Yuan Changsui couldn’t believe it. He reached out to grab the documents from Gu Fuyou’s hand, “Third Gu, how dare you! You even dare to forge the Xuan Miao Sect’s documents?”
Swiftly, Gu Fuyou dodged and slapped the document on the table in front of the elder, smiling, “Junior Brother Yuan, since we’ll be fellow disciples in the future, we should look out for each other.”
Gu Fuyou was wearing a light sky-blue outfit, the same color as the sky. Her hair was tied up in a neat ponytail, with two jade beads woven into the end of the ribbon, vibrant green and glistening. When she turned her head, her long hair and the ribbon flew together, her spirit soaring.
When she smiled at Yuan Changsui, dimples appeared on her cheeks, bright and cheerful. Others who saw her found her even more amiable.
However, to Yuan Changsui, this felt like provocation. His eyes reddened as he watched the elder nod at Gu Fuyou.
The document was genuine.
A surge of frustration filled Yuan Changsui. He had worked hard for years to join Xuan Miao. If Gu Fuyou, who was inferior, could join, what did that make his efforts?
If she joined Xuan Miao, wouldn’t his hard work be seen as worthless, like a joke?
He approached the table, demanding to see the document, “The Xuan Miao Sect is the top immortal sect under the Four Immortal Sects. They have always been strict in selecting disciples. This person is just a waste with poor spiritual roots and only at the Qi Practicing stage. How can you accept her as a disciple?!”
The elder held the document away from him. Yuan Changsui angrily retorted, “What qualifies her to enter the immortal sect? Everyone says the Xuan Miao Sect’s selection is fair, but now they’re using backdoors too. What benefits did Gu Wanpeng promise you? Name a price in spirit stones. I want to buy an inner sect disciple position!”
The elder spoke gravely, “Young man, watch your words.”
Yuan Changsui opened his mouth but, in the end, he could only snort in discontent.
He had a loud voice and, yelling as he was, drew the attention of many disciples.
Gu Fuyou had already extended her hand, allowing the elder to check her cultivation.
Upon feeling it, the elder glanced at Gu Fuyou with a hint of surprise and then said with a hint of regret, “Four spiritual root, Qi Practicing Stage is at its peak.”
This statement set off murmurs among the crowd. Gu Fuyou felt the eyes of many on her.
The number of disciples wanting to join the Xuan Miao Sect was countless. They had always been selected based on excellence. Even three spiritual roots could only be considered mediocre here. Someone like Gu Fuyou was even more unremarkable. If her cultivation was higher, it would be fine, but she was only at the Qi Practicing stage.
In the Xuan Miao Sect, even the disciple with the lowest cultivation had already built a foundation.
These disciples didn’t know why the Xuan Miao Sect wanted to accept Gu Fuyou, but it was nothing more than what that man said about someone pulling strings behind the scenes.
While they couldn’t influence the decisions of Xuan Miao, they could look down upon Gu Fuyou.
Feeling their disdainful stares, Gu Fuyou, although accustomed to it, still felt uncomfortable.
She thought it would have been better to stay home and avoid all this.
Yuan Changsui said, “I told you so!”
The elder calmly looked at him and explained, “She is a specially recruited disciple of Elder Liuhe. Her acceptance is not based on the level of her cultivation.”
Yuan Changsui gritted his teeth, “What do you mean not based on cultivation? She’s just a waste at the Qi Practicing stage, and you still want her?”
Gu Fuyou didn’t expect that a mere document would provoke Yuan Changsui to jump up and down, but it was somewhat useful. Her thoughts turned. Just as she was worried about having no way to escape, this was perfect!
Gu Fuyou leisurely tugged at her sleeves and glanced at Yuan Changsui with a smile. “A waste at the Qi Practicing stage is more than enough to beat you.”
Yuan Changsui glared at her, laughing in extreme anger. “Good! Very good! More than enough? Come and let me see how you’re more than enough!”
That was exactly what Gu Fuyou was waiting for.
In Yuan Changsui’s mind, he had the advantage. He was at the Foundation-Building stage, while she was only at the Qi Practicing stage. He couldn’t believe she could pose any threat.
“If you have the guts, don’t call your second brother for help.”
“If you have the guts, don’t cry for your father!”
As soon as the words fell, Yuan Changsui launched his attack.
Yuan Changsui practiced internal cultivation, tempering his spiritual roots, nourishing his soul, strengthening his spirit, specializing in techniques to summon wind and rain.
Gu Fuyou’s body flew back, her fingers already holding a talisman. She shouted, “Wind, come forth!”
Suddenly, a gust surrounded Yuan Changsui.
He shouted, “Childish tricks!” But then he felt his spiritual energy dissipate and saw a talisman on his sleeve. Enraged, he shouted, “Third Gu, you’re cheating!”
However, in the moment he hesitated, the wind trapped him, ruffling his clothes and hair, making him look disheveled.
Feeling humiliated and resentful, Yuan Changsui’s spiritual power surged, burning the talisman, ready to retaliate against Gu Fuyou.
But Gu Fuyou was ready. Smiling, she said, “You never said I couldn’t use talismans.” She had stuck that talisman on him earlier.
Their back-and-forth happened in a matter of moments. Just as they were about to strike again…
Suddenly, wind rose from the flat ground. In the blink of an eye, a figure gracefully landed between them, holding a scroll in her hand, “Fighting is forbidden within the sect.”
The voice was cold and steady.
Gu Fuyou looked at the newcomer, her eyes widening in surprise. She hadn’t gotten a good look before, but now she did.
The person was dressed in a frost-white robe. The hair at her temples was neatly combed, even tucked behind her ear tips. Her attire was impeccable.
Her demeanor was refined, and her beauty was unparalleled, even more, dazzling than the moonlit night.
It was the flawless white jade Senior Sister Gu Huaiyou had mentioned.
Gu Fuyou sighed in her heart: The heavens are truly biased.
Yuan Changsui was still enraged and couldn’t stop his momentum in time. Gu Fuyou was deliberately looking for trouble.
Even with someone standing in between to block them, both of them didn’t stop. But after taking a step, they both felt an immense force pressing down on their backs.
Both of them collapsed to their knees at the same time, dripping with cold sweat, and their calf muscles were cramping.
Gu Fuyou looked toward the one responsible. Zhong Michu stood tall and poised, her sleeves fluttering in the wind, without moving a finger.
Just the pressure from a Golden Core stage made her feel this overwhelmed.
Yuan Changsui was panting. Even though he had reached the Foundation Establishment stage, under such pressure, he wasn’t much better than Gu Fuyou.
Faced with this intense pressure, Yuan Changsui finally calmed down. Showing off in front of the main hall on his first day at the sect was a great disrespect.
Yuan Changsui wanted to stop. But Gu Fuyou felt that the commotion wasn’t big enough and worried that this minor incident wouldn’t be enough for Xuan Miao Sect to expel her.
An idea popped into her head, targeting Zhong Michu.
Fighting fiercely with a fellow disciple, only to be forcibly stopped by a senior sister, becoming angry and embarrassed to the point of attacking the Senior Sister—a perfect excuse!
If she succeeded, she would have three crimes: being rash and violent, being competitive and eager to fight, and disrespecting her seniors! Enough for her to be expelled from Xuan Miao Sect!
This idea was absurd, and upon further reflection, Gu Fuyou realized that not only did she want to leave Xuan Miao Sect, but she also had a bit of a rebellious streak.
She knew she was just a small insect, but she still wanted to challenge a giant tree.
Gu Fuyou struggled to get up. When Zhong Michu let her guard down, she suddenly attacked.
Gu Fuyou was quick, but Zhong Michu was even faster. With a burst of pressure, Gu Fuyou was directly pressed flat on the ground.
She fell right at Zhong Michu’s feet, her hand just a step away from touching her dress hem.
Before passing out from spitting blood, she thought— a genuine Golden Core Elder is truly not to be trifled with!
 
Chapter 2
Nanzhu Jun 
When Gu Fuyou woke up, she felt a stiffness in her neck. It was as if her head had been hanging down for too long, causing pain all the way to the back of her head.
Upon opening her eyes, she saw a yellow cushion beneath her knees.
It seemed she had fainted while still kneeling, maintaining a straight posture.
This was utterly inhumane. They made her kneel even after she passed out.
Had she been too reckless, making the Xuan Miao Sect members reluctant to let her off the hook easily? Maybe they were thinking of delivering some form of divine retribution right on the spot.
Looking around, she noticed someone kneeling next to her. If it wasn’t Yuan Changsui, who else could it be?
In front of her, there was a golden statue. The statue was about two meters high, stretching to the ceiling. Incense smoke curled up from an altar, surrounded by lit candles. On both sides, there were colorful statues, about half a person’s height, each different in appearance and stretching all the way to the back of the hall.
Gu Fuyou pondered in her heart. This should be the ancestral hall of Xuan Miao Sect, enshrining the colorful statues of the sect leaders throughout the generations. The statue in front of her should be the founding patriarch of Xuan Miao Sect.
Yuan Changsui noticed that Gu Fuyou had woken up. The prolonged kneeling was torturous and boring, but now he had some entertainment. He mockingly laughed at her.
He rambled on, and Gu Fuyou pieced together from his words that after she fainted, due to the commotion at the entrance ceremony, both she and Yuan Changsui were thrown into this ancestral hall to kneel as punishment.
She hadn’t been expelled from the sect, nor had she been executed on the spot.
It felt like she had suffered for no good reason.
Yuan Changsui couldn’t resist poking fun, “Third Gu, you really have guts! Do you even realize who you went after? That’s our generation’s Senior Sister! You’ve barely stepped into the Xuan Miao Sect, and you’re already stirring the pot. You embarrassed her in public, irritated her, and even attempted a surprise attack. I wonder how you’ll survive in the Xuan Miao Sect in the future!”
Gu Fuyou rolled her eyes, thinking, “We both caused trouble. What’s there for you to be so pleased about?”
In front of her floated a wooden plaque, emanating a blue glow. It was a disciplinary plaque, and Yuan Changsui had one in front of him too.
This plaque was the reason why, even after fainting, she still had to kneel upright. With this disciplinary plaque in place, they had to kneel straight for twenty-four hours. Only when the disciplinary order was lifted could they stand up.
Thus, there were no disciples supervising them here. There was no fear that they might slack off and escape their punishment.
This disciplinary plaque contained a formation, which was how it had such an effect.
After inspecting it for a while, Gu Fuyou had an idea. She was well-versed in such matters; these types of formations were merely restrictive and not too difficult to break.
With a flick of her finger, she channeled a strand of spiritual energy.
The blue glow from the disciplinary plaque in front of her faded, and it swiftly fell to the ground.
Yuan Changsui glanced at it and contemptuously raised his head, snorting through his nose, “Little trick.”
He remembered that it was through such “little trick” that Gu Fuyou was admitted into the Xuan Miao Sect. He was quite resentful and said in a low voice, “Third Gu, you don’t deserve to be in the Xuan Miao Sect.”
Gu Fuyou seemed as if she hadn’t heard anything. She stood up, feeling a faint pain in her knees, and her body felt very stiff. Stretching lazily, she could hear her joints popping.
She groaned softly and thought to herself, “How magnanimous Xuan Miao Sect is to not kick me out.”
Had it been the Four Immortals Sect today, she would certainly have been driven out of the sect with a beating. The Four Immortals Sect would never tolerate any disciple being disrespectful and acting recklessly, especially those who haven’t officially joined.
However, the Four Immortals Sects wouldn’t accept her anyway.
Noticing it was nighttime, with the sky bearing a cold crab-shell blue hue, she wondered how long she had been kneeling.
As she was about to leave, Yuan Changsui called out, “Hey, Third Gu! If you don’t complete the twelve-hour kneeling punishment and leave without permission, you’ll be punished!”
Gu Fuyou couldn’t be bothered with him and kept walking.
Yuan Changsui called out again, “Third Gu, wait! Undo the disciplinary plaque for me too!”
Still, Gu Fuyou didn’t stop. She stepped over the threshold of the ancestral hall, descended the steps, passed through the stone gates, and moved away from the ancestral hall, away from Yuan Changsui’s voice.
Two figures leaned against the stone gate. Seeing her come out, they approached her.
Gu Fuyou was taken aback and said, “What are you two doing standing here? Hiding in the shadows, you both look like ghosts.”
Gu Huaiyou handed over Gu Fuyou’s sect attire and identity token, shoving them into her arms, “I told you not to cause trouble, but you just don’t listen. You not only fight others, but you also make a big fuss and provoke a Golden Core stage senior sister. You never give anyone a moment’s peace.”
“She was asking for it.” Si Miao handed over a bottle of medicinal pills, “This will repair your meridians and improve circulation. You can’t withstand the spiritual power of a Golden Core stage cultivator. Be careful and recuperate properly.”
Gu Fuyou accepted it, showing her clean white teeth in a smile, “Thanks.”
The three of them walked side by side in the night. Gu Fuyou asked, “What were you two doing here?”
Si Miao replied, “He was worried about you, but ordinary disciples can’t enter the ancestral hall, so he waited for you outside.”
Gu Huaiyou added, “Ah Man, luckily the Xuan Miao Sect didn’t look into this matter deeply and didn’t expel you. But don’t cause trouble again, thinking of using this to return to Xiaoyao City and give Father and Eldest Brother trouble.”
Gu Fuyou curled the corner of her mouth and didn’t respond.
Gu Huaiyou pressed, “Did you hear me?”
“I heard, I heard. Gu Huaiyou, you’re so naggy.” She was slightly irritated by his words.
Regardless, she had already joined the sect. What’s done was done. She had to reassure herself, ‘since I’m here, I’ll make do’. If she had left straightforwardly, she would now feel a lingering regret.
In the world of cultivation, Xuan Miao Sect stood proudly as the fifth leading immortal sect. The sect leader Ji Zhaoling was at the peak of the Hallow Void stage, just one step away from Soul Splitting Stage. The sect boasted gifted disciples who had made impressive strides in diverse cultivation techniques. Their library was a trove of treasures, setting them apart from the smaller sects.
As Gu Huaiyou had said, joining Xuan Miao was all gains and no losses.
Initially, every hair on Gu Fuyou’s body resisted coming to Xuan Miao. But once she joined, and decided to stay for a while, she intended to study diligently.
But the heavens were determined to annoy her. She was assigned to the same class as Yuan Changsui.
Every day during lessons, she had to see him, which annoyed her.
The only consolation was that she shared accommodation with Si Miao. The two lived in a room with two beds and wardrobes taking up most of the space. Si Miao even placed her alchemy furnace in the center, making the room feel crowded.
…
That afternoon, Gu Fuyou attended a class with other disciples in the eastern plaza.
The teaching master was Elder Jiu Yuan from the Beast Taming Hall. He had a slightly plump figure, a ruddy complexion, and his shiny black hair was tied into a bun. He stood in the center, explaining the ways of beast taming to the disciples.
Gu Fuyou sat under the shade of a big banyan tree on a stone stool, her face in her hands, watching the gathering of students.
Some had already started practicing. Gu Fuyou remembered that one of them was probably named Hua Xi.
She saw Hua Xi forming hand signs in the air, using her spiritual power to form a formation. A flash of white light, and a two-winged skeletal lion appeared out of thin air. Even though it was a young beast, it looked majestic.
Elder Jiu Yuan stroked his beard with a smile on his face, as if saying, “This young one can be taught.”
“Good, make a cut on your ring finger and drop the blood from the fingertip onto its forehead.”
Hua Xi did as instructed. The skeletal lion struggled momentarily, but couldn’t break free from the formation beneath it. Nevertheless, the drop of blood landed on its forehead.
Elder Jiu Yuan spoke slowly with a smile, “Now, the first word you say will be its name. In the future, when the formation is dispelled, call its name and it will respond.”
After pondering for a while, Hua Xi decided on a name and voiced it.
The fresh blood transformed into a red light and penetrated the skeletal lion’s forehead. The lion let out a low roar, revealing a black pattern on the fur of its back.
Elder Jiu Yuan said, “With the appearance of the beast’s pattern, the contract is formed. From now on, it will be your spirit beast, accompanying you throughout your life. It will respond whenever called, unless it’s dead or severely injured and in a deep slumber.”
Hua Xi stroked the skeletal lion’s mane, feeling very pleased.
Not many of the disciples could summon spirit beasts. Most who saw this were intrigued, rushing over to try it out.
As soon as one spirit light dissipated, another appeared. Various spirit beasts were summoned: those that flew in the sky, ran on land, or swam in the water.
The type of spirit beast one could summon depended on the summoner’s strength. Novice disciples couldn’t possibly summon beasts stronger than their own cultivation level. If they did, they wouldn’t be able to control the beast and establish a contract, so these disciples could only summon young beasts.
The quality and future strength of these young beasts were linked to the innate talents of their master.
This was the reason Gu Fuyou, who understood the formations, had been hesitant to summon a spirit beast.
Summoning a weak beast when one is already weak would mean neither could rely on the other. The mere thought was heartbreaking.
The young beasts on the field had just formed contracts and were still in a state of panic, howling and chirping, making Gu Fuyou’s head ache.
She hung her head, covering her ears with both hands, feeling exasperated.
Yuan Changsui saw her in the crowd. He picked up a small stone and flicked it at Gu Fuyou’s head.
Gu Fuyou felt the pain and hissed, covering her head as she raised it.
Yuan Changsui elbowed someone beside him, tilting his chin towards Gu Fuyou.
That person understood, approached Gu Fuyou, cleared his throat, and chuckled, “Junior Sister Gu, I’ve heard your father’s spirit beast, the Golden Peng, can reach the Nascent Soul stage. Like father, not like daughter. I’m sure the spirit beast summoned by Junior Sister Gu won’t be inferior.”
Gu Fuyou glanced at Yuan Changsui, seeing him with arms folded and a playful grin, she realized it was his idea.
Everyone’s attention was drawn by this voice, and they all looked over.
Elder Jiu Yuan sized up Gu Fuyou. He had heard of the commotion she caused when she first joined. With a stern face, he called out to her, “If you lack innate talent, you must work even harder. Your cultivation doesn’t just grow on its own, and yet you slack off. Come here! Practice the summoning formation!”
Gu Fuyou had no choice but to go over, not only having to summon, but also under the watchful eyes of everyone. She was deeply familiar with the formation. With a casual wave of her hand, she formed the seals and activated the formation.
Elder Jiu Yuan nodded in approval. Everyone’s eyes were on the center of the formation, curious about what would appear.
But after a long wait with no sign of activity, someone in the crowd chuckled, “She can’t even summon the lowest level young beast.”
Everyone had heard of Gu Fuyou’s mediocrity.
Contrasting her mediocrity were the famous reputations of her father, Gu Wanpeng, known for ‘soaring to great heights’, and her eldest brother, Gu Shuangqing, renowned as the ‘Rising Star and Tiger Son of a Prestigious Family’.
Hearing was not as good as seeing. Now that they had witnessed it with their own eyes, she wasn’t just mediocre, but simply useless.
Laughing at her words, everyone burst into laughter.
But at that moment, the formation suddenly overflowed with white light, and mist spread across the ground. The laughter turned into exclamations of surprise.
From within the formation, a figure appeared, dressed in white robes with black hair cascading down to the shoulders.
Everyone thought Gu Fuyou had summoned a spirit beast, but it wasn’t a beast at all. It was clearly a person.
The field fell silent. Gu Fuyou didn’t expect this. Although she had made a small modification to the formation, it was still a summoning formation.
A summoning formation should only be able to call forth spirit beasts. No matter how outrageous, it should never be able to summon a human.
Yet, how could this…
The more she looked at this figure, the more familiar it seemed. She stared at the bamboo-green jade hairpin in the figure’s hair for a long moment before suddenly recognizing who it was.
At that moment, Zhong Michu also slowly turned around, holding a scroll in her hand. There was a hint of bewilderment in her eyes, seemingly unexpected to find herself suddenly here.
Gu Fuyou’s gaze collided directly with Zhong Michu’s. Still so beautiful that it made her heart tremble. There was a saying that the love for beauty was common to all. Just looking at such beauty was enough to make one feel refreshed.
The color of Zhong Michu’s eyes was slightly lighter, and perhaps because of the setting sun, Gu Fuyou thought she saw a golden shimmer in them, making her expression seem less cold.
Gu Fuyou approached her, and on a whim, she extended her ring finger, pressing it against Zhong Michu’s forehead before she could react.
Elder Jiu Yuan finally recovered from his shock, his beard bristling in alarm, “You can’t! She’s your Senior Sister!”
Although the pact with a spirit beast doesn’t work on humans, the fact that the summoning formation had summoned a person went against the norm. Elder Jiu Yuan didn’t have time to think it through and rushed over to intervene.
However, it was too late. There was already one strange event, and now there was a second.
Gu Fuyou whispered, “Nanzhu Jun.” The blood from her ring finger transformed into a red light, diving into Zhong Michu’s head.
The pact was formed.
Chapter 3
Zhuo Yue deer
A few days later, almost the entire Xuan Miao Sect had heard about how Gu Fuyou had summoned Nanzhu Jun during her beast-taming class.
The story was so absurd that no one took it seriously. They treated it as a joke.
They said that this mediocre person wanted to show off so badly that she had gone crazy and could make up any lie.
It was no wonder that those who hadn’t personally seen Gu Fuyou’s summoning didn’t believe it. Even Yuan Changsui, who had seen it with his own eyes, did not believe that Gu Fuyou had formed a pact with Zhong Michu.
While the summoning was undeniable, whether a pact was formed was a different matter. Only the master and the spirit beast could feel such a bond. Others would recognize it by observing the beast mark.
A contract with a spirit beast would manifest as a beast mark on the creature’s body, usually easily visible.
However, Zhong Michu was a human, and she wore clothes. Who could, or would dare to, verify if there was a beast mark underneath her garments?
Without evidence, anything was possible.
Yet Yuan Changsui simply refused to believe it. He was convinced that this was another one of Gu Fuyou’s petty tricks.
He believed that Gu Fuyou, who was always tinkering with formations, had deliberately modified something to show off and summoned Zhong Michu.
To him, it was just another attempt by Gu Fuyou to show off, nothing more than a clever gimmick.
Believing he had figured it all out, Yuan Changsui was elated with envy. He shared this excitement with others, telling the disciples about Gu Fuyou’s past “misdeeds” and informing them of his speculations.
Many believed him, thinking that someone of Gu Fuyou’s limited abilities couldn’t possibly bind a prodigious talent like Zhong Michu.
On this day, it was another beast taming class.  Jiu Yuan was teaching at the Jiansu Peak.
Jiansu Peak was vast with a dense forest and was home to many spirit beasts, including high-level ones.
Jiu Yuan addressed the students, “All of you now have your spirit beasts. Regardless of whether you choose to pursue the path of beast-taming in the future, it’s essential to understand how to get along with and control your spirit beasts. They are your most loyal friends, and will never betray you. Once they mature, they will become the sharpest weapons at your disposal.”
“Today, what you will learn is how to hunt together with your spirit beasts!”
Jiu Yuan held a small white deer in his hands. The white deer was small, with a body length only as long as a woman’s forearm, but its antlers had already branched.
This was a Zhuo Yue Deer. It wouldn’t actively attack and was weak and fragile. Its only advantage was its agile body and swift movements. When it ran, it disappeared without a trace.
It was timid and easily frightened, bolting at the slightest movement, making it hard to catch.
The objective of today’s lesson was to capture it within the dense forest.
This exercise was popularly known among the immortal sects as – the Deer Chase.
As soon as Jiu Yuan released his hand, the Zhuo Yue Deer hit the ground and darted into the forest, disappearing in the blink of an eye, leaving only a fleeting white shadow.
With his hands behind his back, Jiu Yuan said, “The prize is a bottle of Zhuling pills. Whoever catches the Zhuo Yue Deer should come to me. I’ll be waiting for you at the foot of the mountain.”
After saying that, Jiu Yuan began to descend the mountain on his sword.
Gu Fuyou called out, “Master Jiu Yuan…”
But Jiu Yuan had already gone far and did not hear her voice. Gu Fuyou let her arms fall in dejection.
Although Zhuling Pill wasn’t a rare pill, it was still hard to come by. Plus, everyone had a competitive spirit, and rushed into the forest one after another.
While these spirit beasts were still young, they had sturdy bodies, capable of carrying their masters. The disciples sat on their spirit beasts with their heads held high, looking quite majestic.
Gu Fuyou stood in her spot, with no intention of entering the dense forest.
She had intended to tell Jiu Yuan that she wouldn’t participate in the deer chase.
The deer chase was meant to train cooperation between the owner and the spirit beast. But who was she to cooperate with?
She didn’t have the courage to summon her Senior Sister again.
In the past few days, the Xuan Miao Sect had been spreading this matter like wildfire. Gu Fuyou was well aware of it.
It wasn’t just strangers who disbelieved her; even Si Miao and Gu Huaiyou didn’t believe her.
However, the pact was truly set.
She had formed a pact with the unparalleled genius of Xuan Miao Sect, the flawless white jade the lofty mountain, the proud frost and snow, the ever-blooming Nanzhu Jun, treating her as a spirit beast.
She had even shocked herself.
Just days ago, she had lamented the unfairness of the heavens. And suddenly, the heavens had dropped a massive pie onto her, leaving her dazed and confused.
But what was the use of setting such a pact? Before she could even rejoice, Si Miao had splashed cold water over her excitement.
“In this world, among humans, only slaves are branded with contracts. Even if you didn’t know the reason and summoned her, how dare you reach out and form a contract with her? Do you have a death wish?!”
“Forget the fact that she’s the sect leader’s beloved disciple; just based on her own cultivation, she is already at the Golden Core stage, a full three levels above you. She can kill you with a flick of her finger, leaving no corpse intact. Her status is so noble, and her future is limitless. Yet, you let her fall to the level of a slave. Where is your brain? I think the only reason she didn’t tear you apart on the spot when you formed the contract is because of her good temperament!”
The cultivation ranks were clear: Qi Practicing, Foundation Building, Body Tempering, Golden Core, Nascent Soul, Hollow Void, Soul Splitting, and Immortalization. The higher one goes, the wider the gap between ranks.
The three-level difference between her and Zhong Michu was like one being underground and the other in the sky.
Only then did Gu Fuyou come to her senses. She clearly knew that when she impulsively formed a pact with Zhong Michu, half of it was out of novelty and the other half was out of vanity.
Her talent was too mediocre. What her cultivation would amount to was predictable. Over these twenty-plus years, there had been little to look forward to.
Even though she herself had hoped for it countless times, she never encountered any heavenly or earthly treasure that would suddenly turn her life around, nor did she wake up one day with her meridians cleansed and her bones changed.
No matter how hard she cultivated, her progress was predictably slow. Years of effort couldn’t compare to a moment of enlightenment by a prodigy.
Gu Fuyou felt that the heavens wouldn’t give her any special treatment because she was just an ordinary person, unlike her eldest brother.
She had an unwilling heart, a fighting spirit, an extraordinary vision, but lacked the natural talent to support it all.
The clearer she saw this, the more bitter she felt.
Summoning Zhong Michu was the second biggest surprise of her life. She was too unwilling to accept mediocrity, so in her desperation, she used the blood from her ring finger to seal the pact on Zhong Michu’s forehead.
Now that she had calmed down, the blood had completely drained from her brain. She realized that she truly had no regard for her life.
Logically, given Zhong Michu’s rank three stages higher than hers, she could have suppressed the pact and easily killed Gu Fuyou if she wanted.
Just as Si Miao had said, among humans, only slaves were subjected to contracts.
Zhong Michu was a favored daughter of the heavens, but now she was under her control. Anyone with a bit of pride would be furious.
The fact that Zhong Michu didn’t kill her was truly a show of great benevolence and virtue.
Once Gu Fuyou understood, she kept her distance from Zhong Michu, and didn’t dare to summon her again. She was afraid that this benevolent and virtuous Nanzhu Jun might lose her temper. Even if Gu Fuyou could escape a death sentence, she might not be able to escape punishment for lesser offenses.
She had been avoiding Zhong Michu for three months now. Every day, she was anxious, fearing Zhong Michu might cause her trouble. Yet, deep down, she hoped to see her.
Zhong Michu didn’t come. In the end, three months passed quietly.
Gu Fuyou planned to sit on a tree stump and wait for someone to catch the Zhuo Yue Deer before heading down the mountain.
That was her plan, but someone wouldn’t let her rest easy.
Yuan Changsui, riding his spirit beast, approached Gu Fuyou. His spirit beast was a young tiger with a pale forehead and white eyes. Even in its youth, it was about three meters long, and with its mouth wide open, it could easily swallow Gu Fuyou’s head.
Jiu Yuan said that in the future, with some effort, it might grow to the Nascent Soul stage, making Yuan Changsui very proud.
Sitting atop the majestic tiger, he laughed and said to Gu Fuyou, “Third Gu, where’s your spirit beast?”
In response to his sarcastic question, Gu Fuyou rolled her eyes and turned her head away.
The white-eyed tiger, being of a proud temperament, roared at Gu Fuyou. A gust of foul wind blew her off her feet.
Yuan Changsui laughed heartily. The other disciples who hadn’t entered the forest yet also found Gu Fuyou’s miserable appearance amusing.
Finding amusement in her discomfort, Yuan Changsui urged his tiger toward Gu Fuyou. It looked as if the tiger was about to step on her.
Gu Fuyou quickly got up, backing away, and said in a stern voice, “Yuan Sheng, what are you doing?”
Gu Fuyou had backed up to the edge of the forest. Yuan Changsui smirked, “What am I doing?”
Yuan Changsui clamped his legs on the tiger’s belly. The white-tiger roared and charged towards Gu Fuyou with a fierce momentum.
Cursing under her breath, Gu Fuyou turned and ran.
Yuan Changsui was in the middle stage of Foundation Building, and the tiger was also in the early stage. Against this pair, Gu Fuyou, who was only at peak Qi Practicing, seemed no match.
Yuan Changsui cornered Gu Fuyou into the forest, playing with her like a cat with a mouse. Not using his full strength, he teased her, laughing, “Third Gu, if you don’t run faster, you’ll be pressed down by the tiger’s paw!”
In this dense forest, it was filled with tall grasses, trees of varying heights, and complex terrains.
Gu Fuyou scanned the surroundings and spotted a grove of red trees wrapped in vines. She changed direction and ran toward them.
In this world, there are two types of formations. One used one’s own spiritual energy to directly form a formation, and the other utilized the geographical advantages to change the yin and yang and five elements to create a formation.
The former type of formation, although its power depended on one’s own strength, was convenient to use.
The latter relied on the timing and geographical advantages and did not require the consumption of one’s own spiritual energy. However, it mostly serves as a supportive formation like barrier formations, feng shui formations, and various restrictions. Their offensive power was not strong, and there were many limitations. It’s also harder to master and is more cumbersome than the first type. Due to its complexity and lesser power, this kind of formation was gradually abandoned. But Gu Fuyou had done extensive research on it.
She ran into the red tree forest, reversed the Yin and Yang, changed the Five Elements, and placed a spiritual stone in the formation’s core. By the time she finished setting everything up, Yuan Changsui had already caught up.
Gu Fuyou had no choice but to keep running, but this time she didn’t seem as miserable as before.
Somehow, in the red forest, a thin mist lingered, and light couldn’t penetrate through. Everything was hazy on all sides. With the branches and leaves overlapping and tree shadows looming, the clear path suddenly became hard to distinguish.
This was due to the formation set up by Gu Fuyou called “Ghost Hitting the Wall”. Such formations work best in intricate paths and between numerous buildings. Although using this formation in the forest diminished its effects, it still significantly slowed down Yuan Changsui’s pace.
Yuan Changsui drove his spirit beast, watching the person in front of him clearly within reach, but he could never catch up.
On the other side, Gu Fuyou occasionally threw a few talismans to counterattack. The spiritual light exploded on white-eyed tiger, causing it to cry out in pain repeatedly, greatly enraging it.
Yuan Changsui laughed, “This is more fun!”
Gu Fuyou’s counterattacks not only didn’t deter Yuan Changsui but instead intensified his efforts.
What made it worse was that other disciples saw and joined in the chase after Gu Fuyou.
The deer they were chasing, Zhuo Yue Deer, was too fast. After searching for a long time, they hadn’t even caught a glimpse of it. And even if they did find it, the deer would only know to run.
Unlike Gu Fuyou, who not only knew how to flee but also how to fight back, making chasing her much more exciting.
As Gu Fuyou ran, she was cursing in her heart while fleeing desperately.
Among them, Yuan Changsui and the disciple Hua Xi who had summoned the skeletal lion that day chased the fiercest.
As Gu Fuyou fled ran out of the red forest, the white-eyed tiger’s claws were about to touch her back.
However, in the next moment, she disappeared into the thin mist. Before the tiger and Yuan Changsui was a thicket of thorns. Unable to stop, the tiger charged straight into the thorns, getting injured all over.
It turned out that there were originally thorns growing here. Gu Fuyou had squeezed out through the gaps between the thorns. The Ghost Hitting the Wall formation had the effect of disrupting vision. Coupled with the thin mist, the tiger and its rider were entirely focused on Gu Fuyou and didn’t carefully observe their surroundings. They actually didn’t notice such a dangerous situation and fell into the trap.
Seeing Yuan Changsui and his spirit beast struggling in the thorns, Gu Fuyou didn’t even have time to catch her breath. Hua Xi, who was following behind Yuan Changsui, rode on her skeletal lion and flew over the thorns.
The skeletal lion had wings and flew like the wind, instantly catching up to Gu Fuyou and swooped down, its claws grabbing her and lifting her into the air.
Hua Xi cheered, “Senior Brother Yuan, I caught her!”
After capturing her, Hua Xi hadn’t yet decided what to do and was confused.
Gu Fuyou pulled out a talisman and shouted, “Spirit, come forth!”
The leaves of the trees fell one after another, and the fine leaves flew around, surrounding the skeletal lion.
The skeletal lion flapped its wings, shaking off the flying leaves, but the leaves went and returned, like sharp blades, cutting the skeletal lion as they went back and forth.
In pain, the skeletal lion loosened its grip, and Gu Fuyou fell from the sky.
After getting up and dusting herself off, Gu Fuyou hummed in dissatisfaction.
In truth, if she hadn’t run, being caught wouldn’t be too bad. At most, she’d be injured but not dead, and she’d become a laughingstock.
But she just wasn’t the type to sit back and accept things.
Even a rabbit would bite when cornered, let alone her.
Not far from where Gu Fuyou was, the skeletal lion and white-eyed tiger freed themselves and chased after her again.
Both spirit beasts were bloodied from thorns and flying leaves, and their masters weren’t faring much better.
Hua Xi was furious, she frowned, complaining, “We were just playing among fellow disciples! Why were you so ruthless in your attack?”
In her eyes, chasing Gu Fuyou was just playful fun, and there was nothing wrong with it. But for Gu Fuyou to retaliate and hurt her spirit beast was a mistake.
With a flap of its wings, the skeletal lion knocked Gu Fuyou to the ground.
Gu Fuyou almost laughed at the audacity but didn’t get a chance to argue. The two beasts, one in front and one behind, blocked her path.
The white-eyed tiger roared furiously at her, advancing menacingly with each step. Yuan Changsui mockingly said, “Run! Keep running!”
With a powerful leap, the white-eyed tiger lunged at Gu Fuyou, its sharp white fangs looking as though they could easily snap her neck in one bite.
Annoyed and frustrated, Gu Fuyou saw Yuan Changsui continuing his torment.
With resolve, she set up a summoning formation.
Thinking they were the only ones with a spirit beast on their side? How wrong they were!
She shouted out, “Nanzhu Jun!”
A burst of spiritual light exploded in the air and quickly dissipated. In the middle of the grassland, a figure appeared out of nowhere.
Kneeling on the ground, the first thing Gu Fuyou saw was a white robe hanging in front of her, embroidered with intricate patterns on the sleeve.
She recognized it as wisteria, outlined in light blue silk thread. This depiction of wisteria lacked a sense of mystery but exuded elegance.
Zhong Michu turned her body. Gu Fuyou saw a wisp of white mist floating in front of her. Upon closer inspection, it was a cup of hot tea in Zhong Michu’s hand, held slightly raised as if about to take a sip.
Looking up further, Gu Fuyou met Zhong Michu’s cold expression.
It seemed that she had disturbed her Senior Sister’s pleasant time of admiring flowers and drinking tea…
Gu Fuyou felt the rationale in Zhong Michu’s eyes was on the brink of shattering, fearing that in the next moment, she might be overcome with anger and choke her.
She imagined Zhong Michu thinking: “You have no idea of the immensity of heaven and earth, yet you still have the audacity to summon me. I haven’t killed you, but you rush towards your own death as if you are tired of living.”
Chills ran down Gu Fuyou’s spine. She licked her lips and gave Zhong Michu an awkward smile, “Senior Sister, it’s been… it’s been a while…”
The white-eyed tiger was already in mid-air, lunging forward. Before Gu Fuyou could finish her sentence, the tiger’s paw was almost upon Zhong Michu.
Zhong Michu casually tossed the teacup in her hand forward, splashing the tea towards it.
It was a small teacup, how much tea could it hold?
Yet, when Zhong Michu tossed it, it seemed like a giant wave had been unleashed. A wall of water, several meters high, erupted from the cup, knocking both Yuan Changsui and the tiger to the ground.
Yuan Changsui lay on the ground, struggling to get up.
The white-eyed tiger had thick skin and wasn’t badly hurt, but its four limbs were on the ground, its buttocks raised high, and its head bowed to the ground, as if it was stuck and couldn’t get up, whimpering. Where was its previous imposing manner?
Spirit beasts lowered their heads to show submission. This big tiger was extremely afraid of Zhong Michu.
Seeing this, Gu Fuyou felt a mix of disdain and annoyance.
“You’re destined to be a Nascent Soul Stage spirit beast in the future, and you’re this afraid of a Golden Core Stage cultivator? Where’s your dignity as the king of tigers? Have some self-respect.”
Without a word, Zhong Michu was about to toss her teacup on the ground and leave on her sword. But Gu Fuyou grabbed the hem of her robe and pulled her back, “Wait, you can’t just leave me here alone.”
As she spoke, she gripped a larger portion of the robe even more tightly, “We’re in a beast taming class. Master Jiu Yuan told us to chase deer.”
Gu Fuyou was all in now, not willing to face an enraged Yuan Changsui and Hua Xi alone.
Since she had already summoned Zhong Michu, come what may, she figured it would be better to die at the hands of a beautiful genius than Yuan Changsui. At least that would be a more dignified end.
Zhong Michu looked back. Hearing that they were on a deer chase and seeing Gu Fuyou’s distressed state, she could somewhat piece together what had transpired.
She glanced at the disciples who had gathered here because of the commotion. Seeing her suddenly appear, they stared in astonishment, just like the last time she was summoned by Gu Fuyou to the plaza.
Zhong Michu’s expression was indifferent. After a while, she said, “I’ll take you down the mountain.”
Gu Fuyou quickly got up. Zhong Michu tried to pull back her sleeve, but Gu Fuyou, with a cheeky grin, let go and smoothed out the wrinkles she had caused.
Zhong Michu started heading down the mountain, with Gu Fuyou following behind. Only now did Gu Fuyou take notice of her surroundings.
The skeletal lion that had previously blocked her way was lying on the ground, its head buried under its wings. The spirit beasts of those disciples were all lying on the ground, whimpering. Some were even shrinking into their masters’ arms, appearing extremely frightened.
The spirit beasts had all fallen, not daring to raise their heads, as if they were all afraid of one person.
As Gu Fuyou followed behind Zhong Michu, every spirit beast they passed bowed their heads and retreated.
Gu Fuyou looked at Zhong Michu with surprise.
It was one thing for young beasts to behave this way, but how could mature spirit beasts, even those of a high cultivation level, show such respect to Zhong Michu? Ordinary cultivators at her level wouldn’t necessarily command such respect.
Could it be that she has some special method to control beasts?
The two passed by a large tea tree, beneath which was a curled-up white figure.
Zhong Michu went over and picked it up. On closer inspection, Gu Fuyou realized it was the elusive Zhuo Yue Deer.
The sight of it filled Gu Fuyou with frustration. She had unwittingly played the role of prey for it, making a fool of herself, while it had been comfortably basking in the sun here.
Before encountering Zhong Michu, the deer had been trembling with fear, but once in her arms, it seemed to enjoy the embrace, looking quite pleased.
Enjoying yet frightened, wanting to rub against Zhong Michu but not daring to.
Gu Fuyou had never seen a spirit beast suck up like this before.
Zhong Michu handed the deer to Gu Fuyou. Gu Fuyou paused, then hesitantly accepted it, asking, “For me?”
Without a word, Zhong Michu continued walking down the mountain.
They reached the foot of the mountain and saw Jiu Yuan in the distance. Zhong Michu called out, “Gengchen” and summoned her spiritual sword, then flew away on it.
Holding the Zhuo Yue Deer in her arms, Gu Fuyou was surprised that Zhong Michu didn’t scold or blame her.
She played with the deer’s hooves in her hands, looking up at the departing figure of Zhong Michu. She couldn’t help but chuckle a couple of times, feeling like she had gotten a great deal.
Chapter 4
Eloquent Words
Gu Fuyou unexpectedly came out on top in the competition, much to the shock and surprise of the elder Jiu Yuan as she took away the bottle of Zhuling Pills.
Returning to her room, she lay on her bed, hugging her pillow and holding the bottle of Zhuling Pills in her hand, turning it over and over, filled with joy as if she were soaring into the sky.
It wasn’t just the Zhuling Pill that made her so happy, it was something else.
She had witnessed Zhong Michu splash a cup of tea that made Yuan Changsui unable to move and scared a group of spirit beasts into submitting to her.
She realized that this person was too powerful. The joy in her heart stemmed from her admiration for power.
Moreover, she found that Zhong Michu might not be as cold and distant as she appeared on the surface. This meant that there was a chance for them to communicate.
“Regarding our contract, I need to talk to her.”
The contract was firmly established. No matter how much she tried to avoid it, it was there. Given the situation, it was better to face it head-on. She thought that perhaps Zhong Michu was also troubled by this contract, and she wanted to assure her that she wouldn’t use it to blackmail her, hoping to ease her worries and prevent her from seeking a drastic solution to break the contract. If they could peacefully coexist, that would be the best outcome
She also had another thought. If Zhong Michu was kind-hearted and willing to lend a helping hand, that would be even better. It’s always good to rely on a powerful ally.
If she could secure such a backer, it wouldn’t need to last forever, just enough to ensure peaceful days at the Xuan Miao Sect.
Si Miao was refining a pill in her room and remarked, “She didn’t come to settle accounts with you, so you should just be quietly grateful. Why do you want to approach her? Are you seeking death?”
Gu Fuyou rolled over, holding the pill bottle to her chest, looking up at the ceiling and laughing, “I’m just going to tell her that I won’t act as a master. If there’s trouble in the future, can I summon her again? Si Miao, you don’t know how powerful she is.”
“More powerful than your Eldest Brother?”
“It’s different from my Eldest Brother; I can’t summon him from miles away in an instant.”
As she spoke, Gu Fuyou suddenly sat up, looking at Si Miao, cutting off what she was about to say, “I think it’s feasible. Remember when I summoned her at the Jiansu Peak? She didn’t blame me, and even helped.”
Si Miao dismissively said, “She just thought you were being bullied too pitifully.”
Gu Fuyou didn’t listen and wondered aloud, “What do you think I should say to her?”
Si Miao, adding fuel to the fire, ignored her.
At that moment, Gu Huaiyou arrived.
The three of them had different schedules, and male and female disciples stayed in separate quarters, so they didn’t see each other often.
Si Miao chuckled, “Gu Huaiyou, you came at the right time. Quickly persuade your foolish younger sister. She’s thinking of ways to seek death.”
Knowing about the incident at the Jiansu Peak from other disciples, Gu Huaiyou came to check if Gu Fuyou was hurt. On hearing Si Miao’s words, thinking that she might have been bullied, he quickly entered the room.
An elated Gu Fuyou rushed out and jumped onto Gu Huaiyou, hugging his neck and shouting, “Gu Huaiyou!”
Gu Huaiyou wrapped his arms around her waist, staggered back a step, and exclaimed, “What’s gotten into you?”
Knowing Gu Fuyou’s temperament, and seeing her joyful demeanor, he knew she wasn’t bullied but must have something on her mind.
Just as he was pondering what it could be, Gu Fuyou excitedly started telling him about Zhong Michu and her plan to rely on her as a powerful ally.
Gu Huaiyou seriously considered the feasibility of her idea.
Ever since Gu Fuyou summoned Zhong Michu and formed a contract, he had been worried every day.
Zhong Michu was extraordinarily talented and was the disciple of the sect leader, Ji Zhaoling. If nothing went wrong, she might inherit the position of sect leader in the future.
How could someone of her stature tolerate being subordinate to someone like Gu Fuyou, who had a mere four spirit roots? And how would the Xuan Miao Sect allow their future pillar to be constrained by someone else?
However, the pact was already sealed, and the only known way to dissolve it was through the master’s death.
He feared that both the Xuan Miao Sect and Zhong Michu might harbor murderous intentions. When that time came, even if Gu Wanpeng stepped in to protect her, it would not be an easy task.
Therefore, he secretly inquired about information on Zhong Michu everywhere. If he discovered any abnormality, he would take Gu Fuyou and run away.
Gu Fuyou knew that he had inquired about Zhong Michu’s background. She was very interested and pulled him to a table, poured him tea, and urged him to explain everything.
He said, “Zhong Michu is the beloved disciple of the sect leader, Ji Zhaoling, and has been with him since she was young…”
Gu Fuyou interrupted, “I know all this, get to the main point.”
“Do you know that Elder Yunar is Zhong Michu’s mother?”
Gu Fuyou looked surprised, took the cup of water she poured for him and drank it herself, asking, “I knew that Elder Yunran and the sect leader were fellow disciples. But I heard that Elder Yunran practiced the way of heartlessness, cutting off emotions and love. How could she marry and have a child?”
With that thought, she mysteriously leaned close to Gu Huaiyou, covered her mouth with her hand, and whispered, “Could it be that Zhong Michu is actually the daughter of the sect leader and Elder Yunran?”
Elder Yunran was a renowned figure in the Five Continents, with profound cultivation and stunning beauty. She was the lofty flower of Xuan Miao Sect, with many admirers across the Five Continents and Four Seas.
Gu Fuyou once found a biography of famous people in which Elder Yunran was described. The book didn’t mention much about her cultivation methods and achievements, but rather focused on her romantic entanglements with several men.
There was a passage in the book that described Elder Yunran as the darling of heaven and said that Ji Zhaoling was a once-in-a-millennium talent. The two were childhood sweethearts.
Everyone thought Elder Yunran would end up with Ji Zhaoling, but in a twist, she practiced the heartless way, abandoning emotions and love, becoming pure and indifferent.
This gave many writers the room to imagine tragic romances for her, speculating she must have been heartbroken to choose the path of heartlessness.
Gu Fuyou wasn’t sure how much of this she could believe.
He tapped her head and said, “You shouldn’t gossip about the sect leader like this.”
Gu Fuyou asked, “So who is Zhong Michu’s father?”
“I don’t know,” he replied. “Zhong Michu was raised in the Gushen Peak and rarely came down. I heard that when she was young, she hardly ever left the peak. Most of the sect disciples only knew her name and had not seen her. It was only when she grew older that she began to venture out.”
What came to Gu Fuyou’s mind was the elegant figure of that person.
He said, “Ah Man, Zhong Michu is a bit indifferent to human emotions. Although she wouldn’t harm anyone’s life easily or hurt you to dissolve the pact, your personalities are too different. Every meeting has been more awkward than the last; becoming friends with her will be difficult.”
Si Miao chimed in, teasing, “Difficult is an understatement. With her wild personality compared to someone elegant and dignified, it’s like comparing heaven and earth. Unless the impossible happens, I don’t see them getting along.”
Gu Fuyou, however, was determined and not disheartened. She said with a smile, “Nothing is impossible in this world.”
She had to at least give it a try.
Based on his description and recalling her few encounters with Zhong Michu, Gu Fuyou could roughly understand what kind of person she was.
With this kind of person, one had to reason with her…
But encountering Zhong Michu wasn’t easy since she rarely left the peak. Gu Fuyou didn’t dare to summon her either, as starting a negotiation with a summoning seemed very insincere.
For several days, Gu Fuyou couldn’t find Zhong Michu. In the end, she decided to proactively visit her at the Gushen Peak.
Gushen Peak is located behind Jingdu Mountain. It’s a quiet and secluded peak, rarely visited by anyone.
Carrying a food box, Gu Fuyou had just reached the foot of the mountain when she was stopped by someone.
The person who stopped her was a guard at the base of the peak. He sternly said to Gu Fuyou, “This place is off-limits to ordinary disciples. Leave immediately!”
Raising an eyebrow, Gu Fuyou thought to herself how mysterious the place seemed.
She decided it wasn’t worth forcing her way through and turned around to leave, discreetly making her way around to the back of the peak.
The back of the peak had no guards, but there was a layer of formation that ordinary disciples couldn’t enter.
Gu Fuyou couldn’t help but want to put her hands on her waist, raise her head to the sky, and laugh out loud. Heaven was helping her!
This kind of barrier formation didn’t pose a challenge for her; after modifying the formation, she smoothly made her way up the mountain.
Upon reaching the bluestone steps, she could already see the courtyard at the peak.
It was late autumn, and it had rained the night before. Fallen red leaves covered the fragrant steps. Looking back down the mountain, thin mist lingered, and a gentle breeze arrived, giving a sense of the unique desolation and loneliness of autumn.
This place seemed much quieter than the main peak.
Gu Fuyou, having ascended from the back of the mountain and walked the stone steps, arrived at the back courtyard.
The courtyard wall blocked her path, and the rustling sounds reached her ears.
She walked to the front of the white wall. This courtyard wall was low, and just by standing, she could rest her elbow on top of it.
Leaning over the top of the wall, she peered inside and saw someone practicing with a sword, recognizing the figure as Zhong Michu.
The courtyard was elegant and serene, with fragrant orchids and grass planted all around. There was also a ginkgo tree leaning against the courtyard wall.
From outside the wall, Gu Fuyou watched Zhong Michu practice with her sword.
Her movements with the long sword were incredibly versatile, and the figure in the courtyard moved as gracefully as a crane stepping through clouds or a jade deer leaping across a ravine, her demeanor both ethereal and exquisite. The ginkgo leaves fluttered down in the breeze created by her sword, scattering like broken gold upon the ground.
She remembered that Zhong Michu’s spirit sword seemed to be called “Gengchen,” its spiritual light sparkling and dazzlingly bright.
Zhong Michu practiced both internal and external cultivation techniques. Internal cultivation focused on refining the spirit, while external cultivation focused on tempering the body. One emphasized techniques, while the other emphasized martial arts.
External cultivation was much more difficult than internal cultivation, and transcending tribulation was also more challenging. It was a lot of work with little reward, so few people practiced it nowadays.
Cultivating both internal and external techniques was even more difficult than ascending to the heavens. Except for those with extraordinary talent, no one would overestimate their abilities and attempt this deadly feat.
If Zhong Michu had not been a dual cultivator, she might have been beyond just the early stages of the Golden Core by now.
Gu Fuyou was so engrossed in watching that she propped her cheek in her hand.
Suddenly, Zhong Michu’s sword movements changed, and she turned swiftly, pointing her sword right at Gu Fuyou’s nose.
Gu Fuyou heard a humming sound from the sword, which stopped just a finger’s width from her face.
A golden leaf slowly fell, touched the blade, and was instantly split in two, disappearing as if it had never been.
Gu Fuyou smiled, straightened her hand resting on the wall, and waved to Zhong Michu.
She noticed a slight twitch at the corner of Zhong Michu’s eyes.
It seemed Zhong Michu wasn’t happy to see her.
Zhong Michu asked, “How did you get in?” Her voice remained cold and clear, pleasant to hear, like a cool spring on a hot summer day. But now, in autumn, it felt a bit too cold.
Gu Fuyou replied, “I walked in.”
Zhong Michu looked skeptical, advancing her sword slightly, “There are guards at the front of the mountain, and a formation at the back.”
Gu Fuyou pretended not to understand, carefully grabbed the sword with her fingers to push it away, then lifted the food box she was carrying onto the white wall, smiling and striking up a conversation with Zhong Michu, “A few days ago, you helped me at Jiansu Peak. I made some food as a way to thank you.”
Gu Fuyou opened the food box, and a sweet fragrance filled the air.
Zhong Michu drew her sword, which transformed into a flash of light and vanished into her sleeve. Turning around, she headed back to her room and remarked, “Thank you for your kindness, but I have already abstained from food. Ordinary disciples are not allowed in here. Please go down the mountain.”
Her words were delivered in one smooth flow – expressing gratitude, rejection, and then dismissal.
In a rush of emotions, Gu Fuyou blurted out, “Wait! Nanzhu Jun!”
Zhong Michu’s footsteps paused, and she suddenly turned her head back, her brows lowered, and her gaze cold.
Gu Fuyou sensed her clear displeasure. “It seems you don’t like me addressing you that way, but I don’t know your real name. My name is Gu Fuyou!”
The title ‘Nanzhu Jun’ is an elegant pseudonym for Zhong Michu. The Nanzhu is a flower that blooms in the mountains, graceful in appearance and able to thrive in harsh conditions, even in winter. Every part of the plant has medicinal properties, and as such, it’s not just a beautiful thing without substance. To be given this pseudonym, it must mean others truly admire her, and it’s a mark of honor for her.
But now, she had overlaid another layer of meaning onto the three characters “Nan Zhu Jun.” These three characters had become the shackles binding Zhong Michu.
She probably didn’t want to hear this title coming out of Gu Fuyou’s mouth.
Facing Zhong Michu’s gaze, Gu Fuyou curved her lips into a smile.
After a moment, Zhong Michu replied coolly, “Zhong Michu.”
Gu Fuyou thought to herself that even though Zhong Michu seemed upset earlier, she still responded, which showed her level of restraint. She said, “Senior Sister Zhong,I actually came to talk to you about the spirit beast contract.”
Zhong Michu’s face turned even more gloomy. The weather today was already bad, with dark clouds blocking the sun and bursts of cool wind. At this moment, Gu Fuyou didn’t know if it was because of her own feelings, but she felt that the light around her had dimmed.
She shrank her neck but still mustered up the courage to say, “I don’t know why I summoned Senior Sister Zhong that day; it was like I was possessed when I made that pact, and it somehow succeeded. I know Senior Sister Zhong is a genius and wouldn’t willingly be controlled by anyone. I’ve been terrified for months, afraid that Sister Zhong would want to forcefully break the pact.”
Zhong Michu remained unmoved. “Elder Liuhe told mentioned you’re skilled with formations.”
Gu Fuyou already understood the implication of her words. Zhong Michu suspected that she had secretly done something to summon her over.
Gu Fuyou raised four fingers to the sky and solemnly declared, “That day, I did indeed make some slight modifications to the formation, but it was still a formation for summoning spirit beasts. It absolutely wouldn’t summon a person. I can swear to the heavens about this. If there is even half a sentence of falsehood, may I, Gu Fuyou, not have a good death!”
This was the truth.
Hearing her words, Zhong Michu’s eyes suddenly moved, and she lowered her head as if in thought.
Gu Fuyou added, “I know that my talent is mediocre and I’m not worthy of commanding Senior Sister Zhong. Therefore, I absolutely, absolutely will not use the power of the contract to force Senior Sister Zhong to do anything she is unwilling to do.” She raised her hand again, “Otherwise, may I be struck by lightning and not have a good death!”
Zhong Michu’s gaze shifted to her, still impassive. “The Sect Leader and Elder Liuhe are already looking for a way to dissolve the pact. It won’t be long”
Although currently, the only known way to break the pact is for one party to die, it doesn’t mean other methods don’t exist.
Learning that the Sect Leader and Elder Liuhe weren’t planning on endangering her life to break the pact, Gu Fuyou thought, “They have a conscience!” This knowledge also brought her great relief.
“Senior Sister Zhong, I’m not delusional enough to think this pact can bind you forever. But since the pact still exists for now, let’s make a deal,” Gu Fuyou gave Zhong Michu a sweet smile, like a ray of sunshine on this gloomy day.
“I don’t know why fate allowed this pact to be formed, but it’s here. You’ve taken the spot of my spirit beast, which means I can’t summon another one. This has caused me a lot of inconvenience. For instance, at Jiangsu Peak, they bullied me because I didn’t have a spirit beast. So, when I’m in trouble, could I call on you?”
Gu Fuyou spoke in a negotiating tone, biting her lower lip, putting away her usual ferocity and showing a well-behaved appearance.
Zhong Michu stared at her, falling into a prolonged silence.
Just as Gu Fuyou began to wonder if Zhong Michu thought she was too shameless and was silently refusing to respond…
Zhong Michu suddenly said, “Once a day.”
Gu Fuyou was shocked. Zhong Michu continued sternly, “You can only summon me once a day, limited to times of absolute necessity.”
The smile on Gu Fuyou’s face instantly bloomed. As if fearing that she would change her mind, she quickly said, “Thank you, Senior Sister!”
She didn’t expect to win Zhong Michu over so easily, yet it happened just like that.
She lifted the food box she’d brought and extended it over the wall, saying, “Senior Sister Zhong, these are pastries I made. They’re steamed with pure cheese, topped with cherry syrup, and sprinkled with honey-soaked osmanthus petals. They taste quite good. Would you like to try?”
Zhong Michu replied, “No need.”
“Those who cultivate often abstain from regular food because it contains impurities that can hinder cultivation. However, the ingredients I used are all spiritual plants. They won’t obstruct your cultivation; in fact, they might even slightly aid it. Are you sure you don’t want any?”
Zhong Michu, with an indifferent expression, said, “This place is not suitable for you to stay long. You should go down the mountain.”
It was the second time she was being told to leave. Gu Fuyou, holding her food box, smiled cheerfully, “Alright, alright.”
After bidding Zhong Michu farewell, she made her way down the back of the mountain.
Walking down the stone steps, she took a bite from one of the pastries, mumbling, “This is my specialty. What a pity she doesn’t appreciate it.”
After finishing a pastry, Gu Fuyou licked her fingertips. When she looked back at the courtyard wall, she smiled sweetly.
She was aware that she and Zhong Michu were very different and might not get along.
There are many kinds of friendships. Although she finds Zhong Michu’s reserved demeanor off-putting, and Zhong Michu might find her frivolity annoying, she still wanted to be around her. Gu Fuyou admired Zhong Michu’s talent, appreciated her excellence, and was curious about why the summoning circle had brought Zhong Michu into her life.
For now, Zhong Michu couldn’t avoid her.
There’s an old saying “Fate has its own plans.”
When she didn’t want to believe this kind of saying, she didn’t believe it. When she wanted to believe it, she felt it made sense.
By the time Gu Fuyou reached the foot of the mountain, she decided that she should cater more to Zhong Michu’s tastes the next time.
As she approached the front peak, she saw the guard, her expression shifted, and she walked up holding the food box with a sweet, ingratiating smile, “Guard brother…”
Chapter 5
Charming Appearance
Gu Fuyou, upon inquiring from the guards, felt that Zhong Michu led a really solitary life.
Usually, she would remain within her residence, never stepping out of the main or secondary gates, wholeheartedly devoted to cultivating the way of the sages.
With such pure cultivation, there was a fear that she would sever the seven emotions and six desires.
Perhaps drinking some tea and playing the zither would prevent her from completely losing touch with the mortal world.
An idea flashed in Gu Fuyou’s mind. Tea!
She was fortunate to have read a wide variety of books in the past, gaining a bit of knowledge about everything.
Making tea, she knew how to do that!
Drinking green tea in the autumn was perfect. right. That time during the deer chase, the place where the Zhuo Yue Deer was hiding had a large tea tree with thick leaves and thriving growth.
Plants growing in places rich in spiritual energy tend to be vibrant and full of vitality. Using such leaves to make tea would surely result in a good flavor.
Gu Fuyou went to pick tea leaves and brought them back. After sun-drying them, she proceeded to roast the tea. Looking around for equipment suitable for roasting tea, she found Si Miao’s alchemy furnace to be just what she needed.
An alchemy furnace had its advantages. The heat control was precise, and Gu Fuyou was very satisfied with the finished product.
However, when Si Miao found out that she had used her alchemy furnace, she pinned Gu Fuyou on the bed, clutching her neck, “Gu Fuyou! My furnace is now filled with the smell of your blasted tea! How dare you use my alchemy furnace to roast tea! Let’s not meet again in this life!”
Desperate, Gu Fuyou kept tapping on Si Miao’s arm, pleading, “Second Sister-in-law, Second Sister-in-law! I’m your future little sister-in-law. If you kill me, you’ll be stuck with my second brother as a resentful couple for eternity.”
Si Miao’s face reddened as she released her grip, spitting out, “Nonsense! You’ve been using this same trick since we were children.”
Gu Fuyou turned over, coughing and rubbing her neck. Si Miao was truly ruthless when she struck. She had always hated people touching her alchemy furnace, and only Gu Fuyou was fearless enough to anger the tiger despite knowing it was forbidden.
“You messed up my alchemy furnace, don’t think you can just brush it off with an apology.”
“I’ll wash it thoroughly inside and out for you, and then put it back into the furnace fire to temper it again!”
Si Miao crossed her arms, “And what else?”
“Plus, a bottle of Zhuling Pill.”
“Deal.”
Only then did Gu Fuyou manage to preserve her life. She took her tea set and sneaked into the rear peak of Jingdu Mountain to see Zhong Michu.
Upon reaching the courtyard wall, she saw fallen leaves scattered everywhere. The yard was silent, with no one practicing swordsmanship.
The doors and windows by the back courtyard were open, and one could see the bamboo curtain rolled up inside, with the bed curtains gently swaying.
The sound of a zither was faint, accompanied by warm fragrance, slowly drifting out.
Softly, Gu Fuyou called out, “Senior Sister Zhong, Senior Sister Zhong?”
A faint voice replied, “Come in.”
Gu Fuyou whispered an apology, “Sorry for the disturbance.”
She flipped over the courtyard wall. Squatting by the wall, she opened the food box and started boiling water to brew tea.
If the tea was brewed and then brought over, it would affect the taste. It was best to brew it on the spot to avoid affecting the flavor.
After preparing everything, Gu Fuyou, holding the tea set, walked into the room, calling out, “Senior Sister Zhong?”
Following the sound of the zither, she walked around the bed curtains and saw Zhong Michu kneeling in front of the bookshelf, with a jade zither on the table in front, a few books piled at the end of the zither, and a small beast-headed incense burner with a wisp of blue smoke curling upwards.
Gu Fuyou saw the pair of hands extending from those silk sleeves, plucking and pressing the strings with slender fingers, the zither music sounding like the trickling of water. She couldn’t help but think of a line from a play she had seen at Yinxue Pavilion.
Slender as bamboo shoots, fine and white as scallions, moist and fragrant, pure and flawless.
They were probably describing a pair of hands like these.
The zither music stopped. Zhong Michu lifted her head and looked at her, “What are you here for?”
Gu Fuyou placed the tea set on the table and touched the cup wall with the back of her hand. It was still warm from being rinsed with hot water earlier, “To please you.”
Zhong Michu showed a puzzled expression. After a long silence, she said, “Since I have already agreed to respond to your summons, my word is my bond. You don’t need to go to such lengths.”
Gu Fuyou smiled, “Courtesy demands reciprocity. If I ever find myself in danger and seek your help, I can’t expect your aid without doing something for you in return. It’s just that my spiritual power is limited, so I can only do small things. If Senior Sister Zhong needs any help in the future, feel free to ask.”
Gu Fuyou presented a cup of tea to Zhong Michu, saying, “Senior Sister Zhong, try it. I roasted this tea myself, I believe it tastes quite good.”
Zhong Michu glanced at Gu Fuyou. Seeing her not accepting the tea, Gu Fuyou leaned over the table, holding the cup closer to Zhong Michu.
Zhong Michu shifted her gaze from her face to the teacup in front of her.
A good tea is defined by its color, aroma, flavor, and appearance.
This tea appeared bright and tender green, with full and fresh leaves. It also has a rich and lasting aroma, with a sweet taste that is indeed tempting, making one’s mouth water and eagerly craving more.
Zhong Michu hesitated. Was there truly such a delightful tea aroma in the world?
Her gaze suddenly shot towards Gu Fuyou, only then realizing that this sweet scent was coming from Gu Fuyou’s body.
Zhong Michu abruptly stood up, knocking against the hand Gu Fuyou extended. The tea cup in Gu Fuyou’s hand tilted, spilling tea, and she, startled by the hot splash, let go of the cup. The tea spilled all over the books on the table.
Before Gu Fuyou could process why Zhong Michu had stood up so suddenly, she saw the tea-soaked books and realized she’d inadvertently created a mess. She moved to wipe the spilled tea off the books with her sleeve, saying, “I’m sorry, Senior Sister Zhong. I didn’t do it on purpose.”
Gu Fuyou picked up the book, intending to wipe off the tea stains inside. Since the book was open, the cover hadn’t shielded the pages, resulting in dark and reddish stains melding together on them.
Ordinary printed books wouldn’t have their ink smudged by a cup of tea. The reason the ink smudged was that someone had used red and black pens to circle and dot, writing many annotations and thoughts. When soaked in hot water, the ink smudged
Gu Fuyou stared at the book, momentarily stunned, and rapidly flipped through a few pages.
She burst into laughter.
This “New Interpretations of Array Formations” book was hers. The annotations and insights written on it were all penned by her. She had almost worn out the book from frequent readings, knowing its content by heart. She couldn’t possibly be mistaken about it.
She had left this book in her study earlier. However, when she needed it later and went to retrieve it, it had mysteriously vanished. Despite searching her entire study, she couldn’t find it.
How did it end up here?
Zhong Michu, upon seeing the now partially ruined book, wore a deeply furrowed frown. Taking a deep breath, she spoke in a subdued tone, “This book was a gift from Elder Liuhe for me to study formations. The unique annotations in it are invaluable, and there’s only one copy. You…”
Gu Fuyou stood up and approached Zhong Michu. With a hint of trembling excitement in her clear voice, she declared, “Senior Sister Zhong, this book is mine. Truly. Look here, I’ve underlined with red ink. These two characters, although scribbled, faintly spell out ‘Ah Man,’ which is my nickname. I lost this book and had no idea how it ended up here.”
As Gu Fuyou spoke, she moved closer to Zhong Michu. But as she neared, the distinctive scent around her became clearer, prompting Zhong Michu to take a step back, her brows furrowing even more deeply.
Gu Fuyou thought she didn’t believe her, so she hugged the book and raised four fingers to the sky, “Really, I… I swear, I swear to the heavens!”
Zhong Michu turned her head slightly, raising her arm so that the flowing sleeves shielded her nose.
The gesture clearly indicated that Zhong Michu detected some intolerable scent.
Gu Fuyou sniffed herself, not detecting any unpleasant odor.
In contrast, Zhong Michu appeared visibly disturbed, her gaze dark and resistant. This made Gu Fuyou wonder if there was something wrong with her own sense of smell.
Taking a step back, Gu Fuyou offered, “Senior Sister Zhong, I’ll make a new copy for you and include all the annotations and insights.”
She smiled, her face beaming with excitement.
Not waiting for Zhong Michu’s response, Gu Fuyou rushed out, calling out as she left, “It will be just like the original.”
“I’ll get it to you within three days. I promise!”
In her excitement, she forgot her original purpose and left the tea set behind. Instead of heading for the main gate, she sprinted towards the wall and swiftly climbed over it.
After Gu Fuyou left, Zhong Michu stared in the direction of her departure for a long time. With a wave of her sleeve, a gust of fresh wind cleared the lingering scent from the room, causing the bamboo curtains to rustle.
After returning, Gu Fuyou hugged the book stained with tea and rolled on the bed, “Ah ah ah ah ah!”
“Si Miao, Si Miao, Zhong Michu was actually reading the book with my annotations!”
Si Miao asked the heavens in exasperation. Earlier, when Gu Fuyou suddenly returned, making a fuss, she had almost caused a furnace of medicinal pills to explode, “You’ve said that countless times already! My ears are going to develop calluses!”
Gu Fuyou continued to shriek with joy, clutching the book, rolling from side to side. Only when Si Miao threw a medicine bottle at her, hitting her, did she finally calm down.
Si Miao remarked with disdain, “It’s just a book with your notes. Is there really a need to be this ecstatic?”
Sitting upright, Gu Fuyou smiled gently, “You wouldn’t understand.”
Zhong Michu was born with a water spiritual root, cultivating both internal and external techniques. Not even a hundred years old, she was already at the Golden Core stage. Her talent and comprehension were both top-notch.
In the Five Continents and Four Seas, such people could be counted on one hand. Even Gu Fuyou’s brother paled in comparison to her.
Such a person was the one Gu Fuyou admired the most, the one she thought was the most amazing. Aside from envying the blessing bestowed upon her by the heavens, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that Gu Fuyou admired Zhong Michu.
And now, this person, who was worlds apart from her, was reading a book annotated by her. From the tone of Zhong Michu’s voice, it seemed that she highly appreciated and cherished it.
The regretful expression Zhong Michu had shown for a moment because of this book made Gu Fuyou’s heart tremble with joy.
The joy brought about by this contrast was something that Si Miao couldn’t empathize with.
Gu Fuyou jumped out of her bed and picked up a new book titled “New Interpretations of Formations” from her bedside. Walking over to her desk, she said, “I won’t talk to you anymore. I’m going to transcribe a book for my Senior Sister Zhong.”
Si Miao shook her head, not bothering to engage with her.
The original book had been doused with hot tea, causing its pages to wrinkle and the ink to smear. Most of the text had become illegible, with only a few sections remaining clear.
When Gu Fuyou used to read this book, she would write down her thoughts as they came. The annotations were all over the place, and her handwriting was extremely scribbled. Sometimes, when there wasn’t enough space, she would even cover the original text, so it looked very messy.
Gu Fuyou touched a line of text at the bottom corner of the book, which read, “Observations of the world evoke profound feelings.” Her erratic handwriting had squished these characters into the corner.
The calligraphy was upright and graceful. It was said that one’s handwriting reflected their character, and it was indeed true. Gu Fuyou could tell from the handwriting that it was Zhong Michu’s.
Holding her cheek and gazing at those eight characters, Gu Fuyou smiled silently. She was so engrossed that she didn’t even notice the red ink from the brush she held staining her face.
It took Gu Fuyou three days to transcribe her notes onto the new book from memory. This time, it was much neater than the original.
She took the new book to find Elder Liuhe, planning to have him review it first to see if there were any additions or changes needed, and also to ask how the original book had ended up in his hands.
The Xuan Miao Sect consisted of nine peaks, with each peak having its own hall overseen by an elder. Each elder was responsible for specific tasks like guarding books, refining pills, beast taming, mastering formations, etc.
Elder Liuhe resided at the Xiyi Peak and was in charge of the Xuan Miao Sect’s formations techniques and artifact refining. He had expertise in these areas and had personally designed the defense formations outside the sect’s entrance.
Gu Fuyou didn’t know how Elder Liu He had come to know her. Suddenly one day, he sent a plum blossom messenger to deliver a document to Xiaoyao City, saying that she was proficient in formation techniques and had remarkable talent, specially recruiting her into Xuan Miao Sect to stay by his side as a student.
Xuan Miao Sect was divided into inner and outer disciples. Inner disciples were taken in by the various great elders and experts of the sect and personally taught by them, while outer disciples only had their names listed in Xuan Miao Sect and received unified lessons from the sect members.
Although Gu Fuyou was personally invited by Elder Liuhe to join the Xuan Miao Sect, she wasn’t formally accepted as his direct disciple, placing her in an awkward position between inner and outer disciples.
Every day, she had to report to Xiyi Peak. Otherwise, she practiced and attended lectures with the outer disciples.
Sometimes, when Gu Fuyou didn’t want to listen to the lectures of other elders, she would secretly slip away and hide on Xiyi Peak.
When Gu Fuyou arrived at Xiyi Peak, she saw disciples sweeping outside the hall.
As she walked, she inquired, “Senior Brother, is the elder here?”
The disciple replied, “The elder is in his study.”
Looking inside through the flower tassel curtain, Elder Liuhe was wearing a black Daoist robe with a scattered floral pattern. From spending years by the forging furnace, his face was tanned red, and his white beard on his chin was as dry as weeds, trembling as he laughed with his head raised.
Elder Liuhe was holding a book and reading it, talking to the person beside him. That person was wearing a smoky green robe, listening attentively with lowered eyes. It was Zhong Michu.
“The annotations in the book are indeed made by that little girl,” Elder Liu He sighed lightly and said, “That little girl has put in a lot of hard work in formation techniques. Nowadays, few are willing to put their heart into this obscure field of formation techniques. Although she has some insights, her cultivation talent is lacking. I’m afraid her cultivation will hardly reach the Golden Core stage, and her lifespan will only be a little over two hundred years. Time flies. Over two hundred years is just a flash of time. No matter how much effort she puts into formation techniques, limited by her lifespan, it will be difficult for her to achieve great success. What a pity.”
After expressing his sentiments, Elder Liuhe then asked, “I find it strange how she managed to form a contract with you. Do you know the reason?”
Zhong Michu paused for a moment before shaking her head.
“Has she ever taken advantage of the contract to mistreat you?”
Zhong Michu shook her head again.
Elder Liuhe continued, “That girl is cunning and restless. I’m afraid she has troubled you a lot. You have also met her a few times. What do you think of her?”
Zhong Michu paused for a moment, then whispered, “Eloquence masks sincerity, rarely genuine.”
Standing outside, Gu Fuyou heard these words. She crossed her arms, reflecting on the deeper meaning of Nanzhu Jun’s statement.
However, even if she did have a way with words, she didn’t believe she was as manipulative as Zhong Michu made her sound.
 At most, she was only a little bit.
Elder Liuhe closed the book with a loud laugh, “And you said she hasn’t bullied you.”
“That girl has been spoiled by her father and brothers, and sometimes she can only see herself. It’s just a child’s mischievous heart, but her nature is not bad. You are her senior sister after all. If there are things you can let go, then let them go. When it’s time to guide her, you should also guide her.”
Zhong Michu responded softly, “This disciple understands.”
As Gu Fuyou pondered, she realized from Elder Liuhe’s tone that he seemed to be familiar with her father. She approached him and greeted, “Master Liuhe.”
Seeing her, Liuhe chuckled, “Speaking of you, and here you are, silently appearing.”
On the other side, when Zhong Michu saw her coming, she bade farewell to Elder Liuhe and left.
Once she passed the draped door, she left without even glancing at Gu Fuyou.
Gu Fuyou said a word to Elder Liuhe and chased after her, stopping Zhong Michu at the steps.
She approached and handed over the newly transcribed book, “Senior Sister Zhong, I’ve transcribed the annotations from this book for you. Here it is.”
There was just the distance of a book between them. A familiar, subtle sweetness lingered around Zhong Michu’s nose. She took a step back, “Since this book is yours, there’s no need to return it to me.”
Zhong Michu refused to take it, so Gu Fuyou took another step forward, handing the book directly to her, smiling, “Then consider it a gift to you.”
Gu Fuyou genuinely wanted to give this book to Zhong Michu. Not to appease her, but because it was the first time someone had so treasured and praised her annotations. She was genuinely happy.
Hoping her writings would find an appreciative audience.
Zhong Michu had only read the first few chapters and found them intriguing. After a moment’s hesitation, she finally accepted the book.
“Then… thank you,” As she said this, Zhong Michu took a slight step to the side and secretly held her breath.
Gu Fuyou noticed Zhong Michu’s strange expression and thought about how she had just taken a step closer, and Zhong Michu had stepped back
At first, she thought Zhong Michu was annoyed by her and didn’t want to be near her. Then, recalling Zhong Michu’s action of raising her sleeve yesterday, she suddenly realized that this person was holding her breath.
Upon this realization, Gu Fuyou was shocked. She instinctively sniffed herself but couldn’t detect any unusual scent. Just as she was about to inquire further, Zhong Michu had already hurriedly left.
Leaving Gu Fuyou standing alone, feeling somewhat disoriented in the wind.
Chapter 6
Xian Luo
Gu Fuyou rested her chin on the pillow, lying motionless on the bed like a dead fish. She asked, “Si Miao, do I have a strange smell on me?”
Si Miao couldn’t take it anymore and threw a pill bottle at her, “You’ve asked hundreds of times already! I’ve told you, no!”
Gu Fuyou pondered, “You think it could be because I formed a pact with her, our relationship has changed, so she can smell something others can’t?”
“There’s no precedent for that,” Si Miao replied.
Gu Fuyou pouted and said, “Every time I approach her, she stays at least a step away from me.”
She thought about directly confronting Zhong Michu to clear things up, but if it turned out to be a terrible smell, it would be quite embarrassing to know. She didn’t have the courage to face that reality.
Si Miao glanced at her skeptically, “Didn’t you used to dislike her being rigid. Why have you been visiting her so often lately?”
Gu Fuyou explained, “You don’t get it. I’m just trying to familiarize myself with her. Even if Senior Sister Zhong doesn’t like me, if I ever need help, she might come to my aid out of this little bond we share.”
Plus, Zhong Michu’s place was so peaceful!
After giving the “New Interpretations of Array Formations” to Zhong Michu, Gu Fuyou received a directive from Liuhe, instructing her to assist Zhong Michu with any questions.
To outsiders, the idea of her helping Zhong Michu might seem absurd. However, Liuhe had seen the original text. The handwriting was so wild and scrawled that it would be challenging for even ghosts and gods to decipher. He wasn’t worried about Zhong Michu understanding the content; his concern was whether Zhong Michu could read Gu Fuyou’s handwriting at all.
From then on, Gu Fuyou felt free, gleefully spending her time leisurely at Gushen Peak.
She no longer had to endure the constant nagging from the old-fashioned elders, who would repetitively preach, “Without rules, there’s no order.”
Nor did she have to bear the disdainful looks from fellow disciples. Gu Fuyou worried, half-jokingly, that their eyes might actually roll right out of their sockets one day.
With Elder Liuhe’s permission, Gu Fuyou visited Gushen Peak several times, and the guards stopped hindering her, although she preferred the route through the rear peak.
Zhong Michu lived in a residence named Hechen Pavilion, a serene and quiet place with spacious grounds and few people.
Gu Fuyou initially thought Zhong Michu lived alone. Although that wasn’t the case, since there was another person who was currently in seclusion, it felt as if there was no difference.
At first, Zhong Michu tried to send her away, but Gu Fuyou boldly claimed she was sent by Elder Liuhe, so Zhong Michu no longer insisted on her leaving, merely treating her like air, staying far away from her.
Being naturally reticent, Zhong Michu barely acknowledged Gu Fuyou, often going an entire day without a word to her.
But that was still better than those who were sarcastically subtle in their mockery. And having such a good-looking person around, even just sitting beside her, was a pleasure to the eye.
Most importantly, Zhong Michu’s place was a treasure trove of books, a truly wonderful place.
Previously, whenever Gu Fuyou thought of skipping the elder’s lecture, she would run to Elder Liuhe’s Xiyi Peak. Now, she thought of skipping classes and ran to Zhong Michu’s Gushen Peak and Hechen Pavilion.
As time passed, autumn gave way to winter, with red maples replaced by white snow.
One day, Gu Fuyou ran up the mountain and called over the courtyard wall, “Senior Sister Zhong!”
The main door was open, still draped with the lake green wind curtains used in summer.
After a good while, Zhong Michu walked out and stood by the door. Her slender fingers lifted the curtain, revealing half her body, her light eyes looking towards Gu Fuyou.
Gu Fuyou asked, “Next spring, when Xian Luo opens, and all the disciples are signing up to travel there, I saw the list posted in front of the main hall, why isn’t your name on it?”
This Xian Luo was a small world naturally born of heaven and earth, said to be the source of spiritual energy nurturing the cultivators between heaven and earth..
When immortals perished, their bodies would fall into this realm, returning their physical essence and fully merging their spiritual energy with this small world. The various magical treasures on their immortal bodies would also scatter within it for the use of the new generation of cultivators.
This cycle continues, ensuring the eternal flow of life and energy.
Because of this, the small world earned a name, called the Xian Luo.
It opens once every seven hundred years.
Within Xian Luo, spirit beasts roamed freely, exotic flowers and rare herbs blossomed across the mountains, and celestial treasures were abundant.
Every cultivator sought to join this lively event, hoping for a chance encounter that could propel them to new heights. Even if they found no such fortune, the experience alone was a valuable trial.
Any member of a sect can enter Xian Luo, but they must register their names in advance. This is to account for any casualties. Those who don’t register are considered uninterested, and latecomers are not allowed entry.
Gu Fuyou planned to explore, thinking that even if she didn’t find any extraordinary treasures, scavenging even the slightest leftovers was worthwhile.
She assumed Zhong Michu would certainly go. With Zhong Michu’s talents, a trip to Xian Luo would undoubtedly boost her cultivation.
But to her surprise, after checking the list at the front of the main hall several times, Zhong Michu’s name was nowhere to be found. That’s why she had run up the mountain to ask, worried that Zhong Michu might have forgotten to register.
On her way up, Gu Fuyou realized the absurdity of her thoughts and chuckled to herself.
After all, who is Zhong Michu? Even if she forgot, would the sect leader forget? Would the senior elders forget? She was just overthinking.
Zhong Michu replied, “The sect leader said my cultivation level isn’t sufficient.”
It turned out she wasn’t planning to go at all.
Gu Fuyou pursed her lips, feeling a bit disappointed.
She figured the sect leader must think Xian Luo was too dangerous and unpredictable, and was afraid that Zhong Michu would have some mishap.
Indeed, Xian Luo was fraught with dangers; a misstep could mean death.
Zhong Michu is still growing, so it makes sense to protect such a talent, ensuring steady progress rather than rapid advancement.
But saying that Zhong Michu’s cultivation was insufficient seemed too harsh. If Zhong Michu wasn’t qualified for Xian Luo, what did that make her, Gu Fuyou? Was she just marching to her demise?
“I plan to explore Xian Luo when it opens in the spring, and I need some time to prepare, so I won’t be able to disturb you at Gushen Peak anymore, Senior Sister Zhong. Take care,” Gu Fuyou said, leaning against the wall with a smile.
With Zhong Michu not going, this inquiry turned into a farewell.
Zhong Michu simply replied, “Safe travels,” with no further words.
After saying goodbye, Gu Fuyou indeed did not visit Gushen Peak for quite some time, as she had said.
Zhong Michu continued her usual routine, yet she always felt something was missing.
Gushen Peak was always peaceful until Gu Fuyou’s boisterous presence disrupted it. Zhong Michu wasn’t used to the noise.
Now that Gu Fuyou no longer came, the peak had returned to its usual quiet—only the sound of the wind, the music of a zither, and the falling snow. Yet, she wasn’t used to that either.
Zhong Michu’s fingers lifted, pausing the zither music as she stood up to set down the instrument and prepare to go outside.
She walked unconsciously toward the back courtyard. Just as she stepped outside, she heard a sound, her eyes briefly lighting up as she turned towards it, only to see that it wasn’t someone arriving, but a pile of snow falling from a ginkgo branch.
Zhong Michu stood still for a moment, staring at the gloomy sky as snow fluttered down like torn cotton. She shook her head with a soft sigh and turned back inside.
As the white snow melted and the warmth of spring arrived in the third month, it was time for the Xian Luo to open.
Located at the boundary between Zhongzhou and Nanzhou, Xian Luo was named Linghua, meaning “mirror,” because each time the entrance to Xian Luo appeared, it hung in the sky like a mirror, reflecting the earthly mountains and rivers, hence the name.
The land of Linghua was an expansive wilderness, where the green grass carpeted the ground as far as the eye could see.
By the time Gu Fuyou and others arrived, cultivators from all five continents and four seas had already gathered. The grass and the hillsides were crowded with people; those who couldn’t find a spot on the ground floated in the air on their swords or spirit beasts.
The crowd was bustling with anticipation, eagerly waiting for Xian Luo to open.
As usual, the forefront was occupied by the disciples of the Four Immortal Sects, their presence grand and imposing. It was unclear whether the many high-level experts among them were there to protect the younger disciples or to hunt for treasures, or perhaps both.
At precisely the third quarter of noon, as a unified shout rose from the crowd, Xian Luo opened on schedule.
Above the wilderness, a point of light emerged, which gradually expanded into a circle of light.
Within the circle, a blue sky and lush green land could be seen.
On the hillside, a Daoist priest holding a long whip cracked it three times towards the sky. The snapping sound was clearly audible on the noisy wilderness.
In ancient times, three whip cracks in the spring symbolized the beginning of the planting season.
Now, the three whip cracks signified the opening of Xian Luo. For the cultivators, it was a time to cultivate their spiritual power, akin to tilling their own spiritual fields.
The disciples of the Four Immortal Sects led the way into Xian Luo, followed closely by other cultivators.
Gu Fuyou watched as the cultivators, riding their swords on the wind, streamed into Xian Luo like a school of fish crossing a river.
Gu Fuyou laughed and said, “In ancient times, fish leaped through the Dragon Gate; today, people enter Xian Luo.”
A mocking laugh came from behind her. Turning around, she found Yuan Changsui looking at her with a strange expression.
She clicked her tongue in annoyance, feeling a twinge of pain in her head.
Ever since she had summoned Zhong Michu back at Jiansu Peak, and the disciples who witnessed it believed that her spirit beast was indeed Zhong Michu, others in the sect had shifted from disbelief to skepticism.
Yuan Changsui had become more reserved after being doused with tea by Zhong Michu. He stopped pestering Gu Fuyou outright but now often cast dark, lingering glances at her from a distance.
Gu Fuyou was worried that one day she might be stabbed in the back; she actually preferred the previous overt antagonism.
As the last of the cultivators entered Xian Luo, Gu Fuyou couldn’t bother with Yuan Changsu anymore. She climbed onto Si Miao’s spirit beast, while Gu Huaiyou controlled his sword, and the three of them entered Xian Luo together.
Si Miao’s spirit beast was a three-legged crow, its entire body aflame with burning feathers.
Among the three, only the spirit beast summoned by Gu Huaiyou, a leopard cat, seemed normal.
Si Miao choosing the three-legged crow as her spirit beast was even more unusual than Gu Fuyou’s choice. Not because the crow was a rare creature, but because of an old legend suggesting that those who bond with this bird would eventually be consumed by its flames.
Many believe in the saying “playing with fire” in this context.
Cultivators tend to heed such superstitions, opting to err on the side of caution, hence the three-legged crow was seen as an ominous creature. Even if one managed to summon it, they would usually avoid forming a contract with it.
Yet, Si Miao didn’t care about such tales and was quite fond of the beast.
She possessed dual spiritual roots of fire and wood, making this fire-element beast a perfect complement for her. It was particularly useful in pill refining, which led her to bond with it without hesitation.
As Gu Fuyou and Si Miao entered Xian Luo on the three-legged crow, passing cultivators gave them sidelong glances, murmuring in astonishment.
“In this day and age, there truly are those who fearlessly choose the three-legged crow as their spirit beast.”
Once they passed through the central light circle, they entered a new realm—clear blue skies as far as the eye could see, with both the sun and moon visible, and the wilderness still beneath their feet.
The grass reached up to their waists, lush and swaying with the breeze, rustling softly.
Inside Xian Luo, the spiritual energy was abundant. Every breath they took felt rejuvenating.
This realm, untouched by humans for seven hundred years, was home to many spirit beasts unafraid of people, who paused and looked around curiously.
Some of these beasts possessed inner cores that could aid in cultivation, others had bodies that could be used to forge magical artifacts or refine medicines, and at the very least, they could be sold at the market for spiritual stones.
The cultivators readied themselves eagerly to capture these treasures.
Unexpectedly, a thunderous explosion erupted from the flatlands, followed by a series of loud bangs, like fireworks during the New Year, ceaselessly shattering the tranquility.
Gu Fuyou looked towards the source of the noise and saw countless black dots falling from the sky, upon closer inspection, they were spiked iron balls.
Gu Fuyou remarked with a cold smile, “Man Tian Xing.”
These explosive sounds came from a magical artifact called “Man Tian Xing.” Initially, it was a palm-sized iron ball, but when thrown, it would split and scatter countless smaller spiky balls, exploding with bright sparks and deafening noise.
This artifact was originally intended for ‘beating the grass to startle the snakes’, to awaken and drive away spirit beasts that are either dormant or hiding. Therefore, this magical artifact is also named “Jing Zhe”.”
Now, it’s been modified to be much more lethal, not only loud but also powerful. It’s a common tool used by the disciples of Xu Ling Sect to hunt beasts.
The ground was repeatedly blasted, breaking the tranquility. Many spirit beasts were killed, while the rest were startled and scattered in panic.
Moreover, some cultivators below were too slow to avoid the blasts and got injured, which immediately sparked furious protests, “Who’s the blind fool who didn’t aim properly? You hurt me…”
Looking up into the sky, they nearly bit their tongues in shock.
In the sky appeared a luxurious carriage drawn by four flying horses. At the front of the carriage stood a young man with rosy lips and white teeth. He was dressed in a purple robe, wore a jade crown, and had a precious sword hanging at his waist, continuously throwing Man Tian Xing.
This man was named Zuo Tianlang, the beloved grandson of the Xu Ling Sect’s leader. 
Upon recognizing him as the instigator, everyone immediately held their tongues.
They thought, “Well, it’s better to let it go. We can’t afford to offend him.”
In this world, apart from Zhongzhou and the Four Seas which were governed by the Azure Phoenix and Dragon clans, the rest—East, South, West, and North—were effectively under the dominion of the Four Immortal Sects.
Thousands of years ago, when the Four Immortal Sects were in their peak, they were merely one of many sects. Each sect was independent.
However, over time, weaker sects began to seek protection from the more powerful ones, offering spiritual stones in exchange.
The Four Immortal Sects seized this opportunity to subtly control the affairs of these sects, absorbing their power. Now, each of them dominates a continent, overshadowing all other sects.
Even so, it was tolerable.
In the three continents of the east, west, and north, the leaders of the Three Immortal Sects were wise and benevolent, promoting capable individuals to lead.
However, the Xu Ling Sect of Nanzhou was different. It was a hereditary sect entirely controlled by the Zuo family.
Such a family was inevitably riddled with power struggles. Instead of focusing on cultivation, they were more interested in power and prestige, leading to frequent infighting.
Yet, the Zuo family’s Xu Ling Sect was the most powerful among the Four Immortal Sects. One reason was that the Zuo family would choose women with exceptional potential to continue their lineage, ensuring that most of their descendants had high aptitudes.
The Zuo family exerted control over most of the Nanzhou, excluding the Xiaoyao City led by Gu Wanpeng and the Xuan Miao Sect controlled by Ji Zhaoling. Every other sect and city were under the Zuo family’s influence.
Considering the vast resources available in this continent, all at the disposal of the Zuo family, it’s no wonder they wielded such immense power. This was another reason for their dominance.
In Nanzhou, the Zuo family was akin to the emperors of ancient times.
Their pampered descendants acted without restraint, competitive and boisterous. Now entering Xian Luo, they were undoubtedly out to make a spectacle.
Everyone feared the Xu Ling Sect of the Zuo family, angry but unable to speak out, nor daring to compete with them for spirit beasts, quietly distancing themselves from the area.
Zuo Tianlang kicked a person beside him and lazily said, “Beard Slave, why haven’t you cast the net to hunt the beasts? If we lose to the side branches of our family this time, I’ll skin you alive.”
The man, standing at eight feet tall with a broad back and a slender waist, nodded obediently. Heeding the order, he jumped off the luxurious carriage, disregarding the exploding Man Tian Xing and went on to capture the beasts with a net.
Not far away, Gu Fuyou witnessed this scene, and it left a bitter taste in her heart.
That “Beard Slave” was a slave. The existence of slaves originated from the Xu Ling Sect and has a history spanning over a thousand years. Although other sects used to openly criticize the Xu Ling Sect for being inhumane, they have since recognized the benefits of having slaves. The criticisms have faded, and these sects have begun purchasing slaves from the Xu Ling Sect.
The Xu Ling Sect had established Bailu City specifically for training slaves.
Once trained, these slaves would serve in noble families. The weaker ones wouldn’t even have names, and their masters would use the product numbers assigned to them in Bailu City, like “Eleven” or “Twelve.” The stronger ones, to show some semblance of respect, would be given new names, but these names would always end with the word “slave” to signify their status.
These slaves couldn’t really be considered as people anymore. They were bound by contracts and were deemed inferior for life.
In the eyes of many, a slave’s life was not valued, which is why Zuo Tianlang could unblinkingly send Beard Slave into the dangerous fields of Jing Zhe.
In Gu Fuyou’s mind, an image of Zhong Michu appeared — exquisitely beautiful and unparalleled in grace.
Regarding the contract she had established with Zhong Michu, Gu Fuyou was torn between guilt and joy.
In a moment of rash decision that day, she hadn’t considered the consequences, nor had she expected the contract to actually form…
Technically, Zhong Michu couldn’t be categorized as a slave. However, when one thinks of people bound by contracts, the word “slave” often comes to mind.
Feeling unsettled, Gu Fuyou silently made a resolution — from now on, she would treat Zhong Michu with kindness and care!

Chapter 7
Dizang
Gu Fuyou and her two companions had no intention of getting involved with Zuo Tianlang. They planned to quietly slip away, blending in with the crowd.
Unfortunately, Si Miao’s three-legged crow was too conspicuous. With just a casual glance, Zuo Tianlang noticed the three of them.
With a voice dripping with disdain, Zuo Tianlang remarked, “Oh, isn’t this the Gu siblings?”
As Gu Fuyou looked over, Zuo Tianlang was already approaching swiftly on his flying horse. “Where’s Gu Ren?” he mocked. “Didn’t have the guts to come to Xian Luo? Instead, he sent two useless people in his stead?”
Perhaps it was his flippant grin, but his words carried an air of frivolity.
Gu Fuyou’s brow furrowed in displeasure.
Gu Ren, also known as Gu Shuangqing, was her elder brother.
Zuo Tianlang had previously faced off against Gu Shuangqing a few times and lost on each occasion. Being prideful, his defeats left a bitter taste, and he always took the opportunity to snipe at any member of the Gu family.
With cold eyes, Gu Fuyou responded, “My brother doesn’t need to hunt spirit beasts to curry favor or boost his standing. With his exceptional talent, he doesn’t rely on external aids for cultivation, so naturally, he wouldn’t come to Xian Luo.”
Zuo Tianlang could clearly detect the sarcasm in Gu Fuyou’s retort, and his face darkened, on the verge of losing his temper.
Suddenly, the ground trembled. Everyone looked down.
The earth cracked open, and some enormous creature was about to burst out from the ground.
The explosive Man Tian Xing had startled out quite a few spirit beasts. The wilderness was now a scene of thousands of beasts stampeding. The ground split apart, and many spirit beasts fell into the crevices.
As the enormous creature’s body crawled out, or more accurately, leaped out, Gu Fuyou and the others finally saw its full appearance. Everyone’s eyes widened.
This creature’s entire body was earthen yellow, as if it was made of mud. Upon closer inspection, one could see that within this ‘mud’ were the bones of many spirit beasts and withered tree branches. The top of its head had a patch of green moss growing on it.
Its overall appearance closely resembled a whale in the sea. It leaped into the air, indeed embodying the majestic posture of a whale breaching the waves.
This thing’s body was incredibly large, like a small mountain. It soared into the sky, blocking out the sun. It let out a howl that resonated through the nine heavens, deafening to the ears.
Zuo Tianlang’s eyes gleamed at the sight of the creature. Forgetting his quarrel with Gu Fuyou, he directed his carriage straight towards it.
Looking at this creature, Gu Fuyou was also itching with desire. “Who would’ve thought that Zuo Tianlang’s reckless actions would unearth a Dizang? It’s like a blind cat stumbling upon a dead rat!”
The so-called Dizang is a spiritual entity formed from the bones of thousands of spirit beasts and the dead vegetation of spiritual plants, which have sunk into the earth. Over the years, these materials mingle through decay and coalescence, eventually awakening with a form of intelligence. Although born from dead matter, the Dizang simulates life more convincingly than many living beings.
It could be said to have absorbed the essence of all things and obtained the mysteries of heaven and earth.
Within a thousand miles, and over the span of a thousand years, it is exceedingly rare for a Dizang to form.
The flesh of the Dizang, whether used in crafting artifacts or in alchemy, is of the highest quality. A piece of Dizang flesh the size of a fingernail can fetch ten thousand spirit stones on the market, and the older the Dizang, the more valuable it becomes.
Similar to agarwood, which forms from the decay and solidification of trees, the principle remains the same: the older it is, the more valuable it becomes.
Just as Gu Fuyou was pondering whether to secretly extract a piece of it, she saw Zuo Tianlang and his men throwing ‘Pan Tian ropes’ towards the Dizang.
This ‘Pan Tian rope’ is equipped with blades at both ends and can be extended at will.
One end of the blade, fitted with barbs, would embed itself into the gaps of a spirit beast’s bones and unfold to hook onto the bone securely, while the other end would pierce into rock. Even as the blood of the struggling spirit beast drained, escape was nearly impossible. These ropes were traditionally used in capturing large spirit beasts.
Several Pan Tian ropes were already embedded into the Dizang. Driven by his ambition, Zuo Tianlang aimed not only to secure a piece of Dizang flesh but also to capture the entire creature.
As the Dizang roared skyward, bombarded by Zuo Tianlang’s Tian Xing, Gu Fuyou’s eyelids twitched, and she silently abandoned the idea of carving out a piece of its flesh.
The Dizang, a collector of the spiritual essence of countless deceased creatures and plants, has the power to decompose the corpses of spirit beasts and spiritual plants, transforming them into spiritual energy that nourishes the land.
The formation of a Dizang is an exceedingly rare occurrence, and in some places, it is revered as a guardian deity of the land.
Even when cultivators seek to harvest its flesh, they typically extract only a small piece, always with respect and gratitude toward nature. After extracting, they would typically offer prayers, seeking forgiveness for their actions.
Zuo Tianlang, however, harbored other intentions. Not satisfied with merely capturing the Dizang, he appeared determined to subdue it, possibly aiming to break it into smaller pieces for easier transport.
It is crucial to understand that once the Dizang becomes sentient, it also develops a temperament.
Though the Dizang is generally mild-mannered, and it did not attack the cultivators even when disturbed by Zuo Tianlang’s Tian Xing, its reaction to continued aggression is unpredictable.
Disregarding the formidable spiritual powers of a millennia-old Dizang, just its immense size alone is enough to pose a serious challenge to all present.
Gu Fuyou nudged Si Miao, whispering to her, “We’d better stay far away. This young master will surely cause trouble sooner or later.”
Both Si Miao and Gu Huaiyou nodded in agreement and headed towards the east.
Within Xian Luo, there are three distinct layers—inner, middle, and outer—and young disciples like them were restricted to the outer layer. Venturing into the middle layer was risky even for those at the Nascent Soul stage, and the inner layer was off-limits even to old elders.
The deeper one goes, the more dangerous it becomes.
The scenery within Xian Luo differed from the outer world, following its own unique set of rules.
Here, the climate and terrain were bizarre and wonderful—day and night could coexist, winter neighbored summer, a mountain could hide both ice and fire, and at the end of a desert, a deep sea might appear—these were some of the marvels found within Xian Luo.
The three approached a withered forest near the wilderness. A group of cultivators was searching the woods for precious flowers, herbs, rare beasts, and birds. Upon spotting the three, they initially tensed, fearing a confrontation over treasures.
Upon closer inspection, they relaxed, recognizing them as fellow sect members.
These cultivators were also disciples of the Xuan Miao Sect.
Gu Fuyou felt a headache coming on, sighed deeply, and leaned her head against Si Miao’s back.
Behind them was Zuo Tianlang, and ahead, Yuan Changshui.
She thought, “I should’ve checked the almanac before leaving; this trip is proving to be inauspicious.”
Just as Gu Fuyou was about to suggest to Si Miao that they should move to another spot, she heard a flurry of panicked shouts.
The Xuan Miao disciples stared past them into the sky, pointing and gaping, “What is that thing?!”
Gu Fuyou felt a gust of wind from behind, as if from a giant creature flying overhead. She turned around abruptly, just in time to see the Dizang leap from the ground, roaring as it headed their way.
It was still entangled with the Pan Tian ropes, likely enraged by Zuo Tianlang’s Tian Xing, and it had used its massive body to yank the ropes right out of the ground.
Zuo Tianlang and a few others, gripping the Pan Tian Ropes, stood atop the Dizang, relentlessly attacking it, determined to capture it.
Gu Fuyou inhaled sharply and exclaimed, “Let’s go!”
Before the Dizang gets angry, it would typically ignore you regardless of how much flesh you extract. However, once enraged, it wouldn’t care if you were human, ghost, God, or demon—it would destroy first without hesitation.
As the Dizang moved, it resembled a pufferfish inflating itself, turning the land and air around it into a river. It would leap from the ground into the air, flying for a distance, then dive back down, continuing its journey through the earth.
When the Dizang burrowed into the earth, it stirred up numerous clods of soil that shot outwards like thunderbolts in all directions.
The three-legged crow had barely landed before it took flight again, attempting to escape the area of conflict. However, as soil and stones rained down like a storm, they struck its wings and feathers.
It let out a pained cry and plummeted to the ground.
Gu Huaiyou shouted in alarm: “Si Miao, Ah Man!”
He too fell down after them.
The injured three-legged crow shrank to the size of a small arm and was quickly scooped up by Si Miao, cradling it in her arms.
Gu Huaiyou asked the two, “Are you hurt?”
Gu Fuyou replied, “I’m fine.”
They got up and resumed their desperate escape. With the ground crumbling beneath their feet and rocks falling from above, neither walking nor flying seemed safe.
After a moment’s consideration, Gu Fuyou decided to proceed on foot—not because it was faster; flying on a sword would naturally be quicker. However, such speed was insignificant compared to the Dizang’s ability to leap three thousand feet in a single bound.
Their cultivation levels were too low to completely evade the Dizang by flying on swords.
The quickest and most convenient way to escape would be to find a teleportation formation, which could cover great distances in a single step.
She recalled an elder mentioning that within Xian Luo, there were countless formations, some hidden within a single flower or leaf, with teleportation formations being the most common.
This area was a hub of spiritual energy, with paths branching out in all directions. The spiritual energy here moved swiftly, spreading outwards like tentacles reaching into every corner. It was certain that teleportation formations were present nearby.
Gu Fuyou instructed Si Miao and Gu Huaiyou to manage the falling rocks while she leaped across the fractured earth, searching for a formation.
Frustratingly, although she knew there were teleportation formations here, she could not pinpoint their exact locations; she had to search bit by bit.
The Dizang was moving through the earth, fighting with Zuo Tianlang and his men not far from them. If the Dizang decided to leap towards them, it could crush all three of them.
As Gu Fuyou searched for the formation, she silently prayed in her heart that the Dizang would stay away.
Fate, however, was not on their side.
For reasons unknown, Yuan Changshui, who was nearby, threw one of Zuo Tianlang’s Tian Xing at the Dizang, perhaps attempting to help or for some other motive.
However, he didn’t know how to properly use this magical artifact. When the Tian Xing exploded near the Dizang, it rebounded and detonated closer to them.
There’s a saying that enemies often cross each other’s paths
Gu Fuyou, who was close by and focused on finding the formation, did not expect this. The Tian Xing exploded next to her, and before she could react, sparks burst open on her left side.
She was knocked to the ground by the force, her ears ringing, and as she staggered to her feet, she felt a burning pain on her forehead and saw her hand covered in blood.
She glared at Yuan Changshui, shouting, “Did you do that on purpose?”
Yuan Changsu, either dazed by the Tian Xing blast or stunned to see that he had accidentally struck a teammate, just stared blankly at Gu Fuyou.
Before Gu Fuyou could retaliate, the Dizang suddenly let out another roar.
Blessings don’t come in pairs, but misfortunes never come alone.
The Dizang, whether attracted by the noise of the Tian Xing or something else, suddenly turned and leaped towards them. Its massive body soared from the earth and with its mouth agape, it seemed poised to swallow them whole.
Under the immense pressure of the descending giant, Gu Fuyou found herself paralyzed, unable to move. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Si Miao and Gu Huai You, one on each side, reaching out in a split-second decision to push her away.
The Dizang was enormous; as Si Miao and Gu Huaiyou used a wind spell to shield her from harm, Gu Fuyou narrowly missed the Dizang’s jaws.
Si Miao and Gu Huai You, however, weren’t so lucky. Because they had pushed Gu Fuyou to safety, they couldn’t escape in time and were caught in the Dizang’s bite.
Once the Dizang had clamped onto its targets, it dove back into the earth, shattering the surrounding ground as it disappeared.
“Brother! Si Miao!” Gu Fuyou, in a swift reaction, grabbed onto the protruding corner of the Dizang’s mouth with one hand and lay on the side of the Dizang’s body, falling underground with it.
Inside the Dizang’s mouth, there were no sharp teeth or stomach, and it couldn’t digest food. Although there was no immediate danger for the two inside the Dizang’s mouth, staying too long would expose them to the toxic miasma of decay, leading to poisoning. She needed to find a way to rescue them quickly.
Gu Fuyou fumbled with her storage bag at her waist, searching for any useful talisman.
Unexpectedly, the hand gripping the Dizang’s mouth corner slipped—not because she had loosened her grip, but because the flesh of the Dizang was soft and loose, easily tearing away when pulled.
She accidentally ripped off a piece of the Dizang’s mouth, losing her grip. Her body was immediately thrown against a dirt wall by a downward gust of wind.
As fate would have it, the teleportation formation she had been searching for was right there on the dirt wall, and she had just pulled out a spirit stone from her storage bag.
If a teleportation formation could be likened to a door, a spirit stone filled with spiritual energy was the key.
She didn’t even have time to determine the distance or direction of the teleportation formation.
With a flash of spiritual light, the formation activated.
In an instant, she was transported thousands of miles away.
When Gu Fuyou blinked and fell from the sky, she was no longer in the deep abyss created by the Dizang’s impact. Instead, she found herself in a pitch-black place with a bright, circular patch of white sky overhead.
It seemed like the bottom of a well.
Gu Fuyou landed on solid ground, but surprisingly, it didn’t hurt. Feeling around beneath her, she found it quite soft and warm.
Using the light from above, she saw clearly that she was on a patch of snow-white, rising and falling beneath her.
Shifting her gaze upward, she met a pair of round, brown beast eyes. She froze for a moment, then was startled awake by the sound of a wild beast’s purr.
From the tiger’s den into the wolf’s lair—she had fallen into a snow bear’s den, directly onto the bear’s belly.
Gu Fuyou’s mind raced, her hands frantically searching through her storage bag, but in her urgency, she couldn’t find the talisman she needed.
She mentally vowed that once she had a moment, she would organize her storage pouch categorically.
Just as she managed to pull out a Wind Riding Talisman before the snow bear could reach her, she threw the talisman and cried out, “Wind, come!”
A gust of wind lifted her from the ground, carrying her straight up to the opening of the den.
Gu Fuyou leaped out and looked back to see she was in a snow-covered forest.
The place she had fallen into earlier was the bottom of a tree hollow in a tree that would take a dozen people to encircle with their arms.
Before she could take in her surroundings, a roar came from the hollow, and the snow bear leaped out.
Gu Fuyou turned and ran, shouting as she fled, “I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to fall into your home!”
She thought the snow bear might be cranky from having its sleep disturbed or perhaps it was just hungry after a long hibernation, but it relentlessly pursued her.
Gu Fuyou felt it was unfair—her talents might be mediocre, but now even her luck seemed to be failing.
Looking around, she saw only the towering, sturdy pines of the snowy forest and suddenly had an idea.
She couldn’t outrun the snow bear, which was at least at the Foundation Building stage.
Her only chance was to take the initiative. Luckily, such spirit beasts did not develop intelligence while building their qi foundation.
In short, they were brainless and easier to deceive.
Gu Fuyou pulled out a stack of talismans as she ran past a tree, slapping one on it. She rounded another tree and affixed another talisman, with the snow bear relentlessly following her loops around the area. She continued to run in tight circles, placing talismans on all the surrounding trees.
Thankfully, her past days spent jumping and darting about, coupled with a stint focused on physical training, had made her agile. Otherwise, the snow bear would have easily caught her by now.
After placing the last talisman, Gu Fuyou halted, turned to face the charging snow bear, and shouted, “Bind!”
The talismans on the surrounding pine trees bore the image of a closed eye. As her command echoed, the eyes on the talismans opened, shooting out a red beam that tightly wound around the snow bear.
Naturally, the snow bear struggled fiercely, but the thread was both thin and resilient, refusing to break. The more the bear struggled, the tighter the thread constricted, embedding deeply into its flesh.
The snow bear, fierce and brawny, managed to uproot the towering pines.
Gu Fuyou cautiously took a step back. Initially, she had intended to kill the snow bear to harvest its inner core, but now it seemed wiser to prioritize her safety and escape.
Dizzy and utterly drained, Gu Fuyou could no longer think to use another talisman. Her slow pace didn’t get her far before a loud crash sounded from behind.
Turning, she saw the snow bear had collapsed from exhaustion, pinned under the fallen pine trees. The red thread had cut deeply into its flesh, with blood staining the snow around it.
Hesitating only for a moment, Gu Fuyou decided to go back for the core—it was not every day one managed to kill such a creature.
As she approached, she noticed the bear was on its last breath. She took out a talisman and delivered the final blow. Just as she was about to extract the core, a roar echoed from the depths of the forest, making her heart skip a beat.
She looked towards the source of the roar, stumbling backward in shock and falling to the ground.
From the direction she had fled came another snow bear—larger, stronger, and more ferocious, standing over ten feet tall.
Glancing at the dead bear, Gu Fuyou realized in horror it was just a young cub. And the roaring newcomer? Likely its mother?
Just as one crisis had passed, another had risen.
“This is it, I shouldn’t have come back,” Gu Fuyou thought despairingly. “When luck turns against you, even drinking water gets stuck between your teeth.”
The mother must be at the phase of a Body Tempering or Golden Core stage, far beyond her capacity to fight, especially in her current exhausted state.
She didn’t want to die, but she was out of options.
In a moment of desperation, she mustered the last bit of her spiritual energy to create a formation. Then, she cried out to the heavens, “Nanzhu Jun, save me!”
Chapter 8
Sister
With a flash of light, Zhong Michu appeared out of thin air.
Upon seeing her, Gu Fuyou’s mouth twitched involuntarily.
Zhong Michu stood barefoot, her jade-white toes pressing into the snowy ground. The sash of her robe was undone, and she held a snowy white ribbon, busily tying up her hair.
The timing of the summon wasn’t good; she probably intended to take a bath.
Luckily, she wasn’t summoned when she was completely naked. If that had been the case, this person would probably not come to save her, but to kill her instead.
Still, when Zhong Michu turned her head, her expression was far from pleased.
She casually tied her hair, the black hair on her temples was still neatly combed, half of her ear hidden under the hair.
Gu Fuyou weakly cried out, “Save me!”
Summoning her at such a moment wasn’t intentional but a matter of necessity.
Zhong Michu glanced at her and, after a pause, asked, “Is this Xian Luo?”
Gu Fuyou nodded. Zhong Michu, however, turned to leave, saying, “The journey of Xianluo is meant for cultivation. All hardships are to temper the spirit, and all storms and thunders are to forge the body. If you seek external help at the slightest difficulty, how can you progress? You must seek opportunities amidst dangers.”
In her mind, Gu Fuyou thought, “I’ve already encountered enough difficulties. If I don’t seek help, it won’t be tempering anymore, but directly crushing me to death!”
Gu Fuyou hurriedly stopped her, “You promised me that I could summon you in dire situations.”
Zhong Michu replied, “That’s under normal circumstances. Our sect has rules against entering Xian Luo without prior permission. Moreover, our sect leader explicitly forbade me from entering Xian Luo. You should be aware of that.”
“I…” Gu Fuyou knew that summoning Zhong Michu would cause her to defy her master’s orders and the sect’s rules, which is why she had not summoned her earlier; otherwise, she would have done so at the first encounter with Dizang.
“I’m sorry… After going out, I will explain to the sect leader and bear the responsibility. But you’ve already come, so can you help me now? My brother and Si Miao are still trapped. I…”
At present, she was separated from Gu Huaiyou and Si Miao, and she was exhausted and alone. It was difficult to pass the current obstacle, let alone go and save the two of them.
Zhong Michu remained silent. Taking a deep breath, Gu Fuyou exclaimed, “I don’t care! You can’t leave! Originally, it was allowed to bring spirit beasts to travel together in Xianluo. Letting one’s own spirit beast help doesn’t count as relying on external forces! You took the position of my spirit beast, so you have to be responsible for me till the end!”
Gu Fuyou couldn’t care less about the consequences. Even if it meant acting unreasonably and persistently, she couldn’t let Zhong Michu leave.
If Zhong Michu left, she would surely die here.
When Zhong Michu turned around, she noticed a roaring snow bear approaching, and her expression shifted slightly.
The snow bear came with a fierce momentum, looking very majestic, and its power seemed to have reached a certain advanced stage.
Gu Fuyou wasn’t lying; her life was genuinely hanging by a thread.
Zhong Michu considered Gu Fuyou’s words, remaining silent for a moment, evidently hesitating.
Gu Fuyou stared intently at the back of Zhong Michu’s head, waiting for a response. Seeing her silent, fearing she might fly away, she suddenly lunged forward and clung to Zhong Michu’s legs.
Zhong Michu stiffened, her face twitching in surprise, she exclaimed, “What are you doing!”
Gu Fuyou retorted, “If you won’t save me, then let’s die together!”
“You! Let go!” Zhong Michu’s face flushed.
While the two were talking, the snow bear had already charged close and looked set to pounce.
Zhong Michu swiftly grabbed Gu Fuyou by the arm and called out, “Gengchen!”
A flash of sword light emerged from her sleeve, lifting them both into the air, carrying them several dozen feet away.
Zhong Michu said, “I’ll help you. Now let go.”
Gu Fuyou, thinking she might have misheard, looked up at her and asked, “You’ll help me?”
After seeing the seriousness in Zhong Michu’s face, Gu Fuyou quietly relaxed her hold, positioning herself behind Zhong Michu, only peeking her head out to observe the approaching snow bear.
The snow bear, all four limbs on the ground, charged swiftly. When it neared, it suddenly stood upright, leaping about three meters into the air with a nimble grace that made Gu Fuyou exclaim, “Such agility!”
Zhong Michu glanced at her from the corner of her eye. With a raise of her left hand, wind and snow rose, swirling upwards, trapping the snow bear in the middle.
With a quick flick of her fingers, the soft, fluffy snow instantly transformed into a clear, hard pillar of ice, trapping the snow bear’s legs and suspending it helplessly in mid-air.
Gu Fuyou was astonished. Wasn’t Zhong Michu a water spiritual root? How could she use ice techniques so skillfully?
As Gengchen carried Zhong Michu closer to the snow bear, it, seeing them approach, began to swipe wildly with its free arms.
Zhong Michu extended her right hand, signaling for the bear to stop.
The snow bear immediately quieted down, though its beastly eyes remained red and it growled softly at Zhong Michu.
Gu Fuyou thought to herself that Zhong Michu must have mastered the art of beast taming.
It seemed like the snow bear was trying to communicate something to Zhong Michu, so Gu Fuyou asked, “Senior Sister Zhong, what’s it saying?”
Zhong Michu turned to look at Gu Fuyou, with her scrutinizing gaze, and asked, “Did you kill its young cub?”
Gu Fuyou did not understand the implication of her scrutiny. In fact, Zhong Michu was astonished that the young snow bear, already at the initial stage of foundation building, had been killed by Gu Fuyou, who only had the full cultivation of Qi training, and without being seriously injured herself. Ordinary mediocre talents couldn’t achieve this.
Gu Fuyou, however, thought Zhong Michu knew that this trouble was her own doing, and with an awkward smile, she explained, “I just accidentally fell into that snow bear’s cave and accidentally disturbed its hibernation. It chased me to the death and wouldn’t stop until it killed me. I had no choice but to fight back…”
The snow bear roared a few more times. Gu Fuyou asked, “What did that snow bear say?”
She always felt that spirit beasts showed particular respect in front of Zhong Michu, even their roars of rage seemed restrained; she suspected it was some trick of beast control and planned to ask Zhong Michu for lessons when the opportunity arose.
Zhong Michu hadn’t answered when Gu Fuyou guessed, “Is it sparing me this time for your sake, and there won’t be a next time?”
Just as she finished speaking, the snow bear roared loudly and with a crack, broke free from the ice pillar, landing on the flat surface of the broken ice, ready to leap again.
This time, it was prepared. It wouldn’t be easily subdued by Zhong Michu’s techniques.
Zhong Michu calmly said, “It says, ‘The vengeance for killing my child is irreconcilable, even if it costs me my life, I demand blood for blood.’”
Gu Fuyou didn’t believe a spirit beast could articulate such sophisticated words. She was convinced that Zhong Michu had just embellished the beast’s intention and said such words to scare her.
Just as Gu Fuyou was about to object, the snow bear pounced, and the tip of the Gengchen sword suddenly rose, piercing straight into the sky.
In a flash, the sword dispersed the dust, the snow bear tried to pursue but couldn’t match the speed and roared skyward in frustration.
Zhong Michu could have defeated the bear, but saw no reason to engage it needlessly. Moreover, she pitied the creature for losing its cub, so she chose to flee to conserve energy.
Zhong Michu carried Gu Fuyou eastward on her sword. Gu Fuyou had no idea which part of Xianluo she had been transported to from the teleportation formation. She only saw that the snowy forest below had ended abruptly at a cliff. Below, the surging waves crashed against the shore, and ahead, the green waves merged with the sky, forming an endless sea.
Zhong Michu landed on the sandy beach below the cliff. She put away the Gengchen sword and stepped onto the soft, fine sand.
Gu Fuyou also jumped down to the beach, found a rock to sit on, and took a deep breath, her mind racing with thoughts of how to find her way back to the barren forest.
Zhong Michu glanced at her and reached into her sleeve, pulling out a handkerchief to hand to her, saying, “Wipe it.”
Gu Fuyou took it with both hands, staring blankly at her.
Zhong Michu added, “Face.”
Only then did Gu Fuyou realize that she had been hit by the Man Tian Xing earlier and was injured on her forehead, with blood flowing down her face. She touched it, and the blood had already coagulated, along with her hair being clumped together. “Thank you, Senior Sister.”
When Gu Fuyou caught sight of herself in the water, she couldn’t help but feel sorry for the person looking back at her.
She dipped the handkerchief in the water to wet it, then wiped the blood from her face, turning the pristine white fabric bright red with a single swipe.
Gu Fuyou thought, every time she summoned Zhong Michu, things always seemed to go from bad to worse.
Zhong Michu tidied the hem of her clothes, which had been disheveled when Gu Fuyou hugged her legs. As she brushed the fabric, the faint yet seductive scent of Gu Fuyou’s body lingered on her clothes.
Zhong Michu, recalling how Gu Fuyou had desperately clung to her, sighed softly, “How can there be a girl like you in this world?”
Zhong Michu emphasized “a girl like you.” However, in Gu Fuyou’s ears, she heard an emphasis on “girl.”
After rinsing the blood-stained handkerchief in the sea, Gu Fuyou turned and smiled mischievously, hinting towards her chest and said, “Do you think I don’t look like a lady, Senior Sister Zhong? Would you like to check?”
Zhong Michu’s expression darkened, “Frivolous.”
Gu Fuyou couldn’t help but burst into laughter. She had predicted Zhong Michu’s reply word for word. The relief of having survived made her feel giddy. She laughed so hard that tears formed.
As she was laughing, out of the corner of her eye, she noticed something moving in the sand beside her. When she looked directly at it, a creature emerged from the sand, waving two large pincers and crawling towards her – a crab.
She jumped up in horror because, instead of a regular shell, the back of this crab had a human face. Although small, the face was fully formed with all features.
This is a humanoid-faced crab.
Gu Fuyou’s hair stood on end. “Ahhhhhh!”
That human face had its eyes and mouth tightly closed. When Gu Fuyou screamed, the human face suddenly opened its mouth and also followed, “Ahhhhhh!”
Its sharp and piercing cry completely overshadowed Gu Fuyou’s voice.
The surrounding sand began to shift, and one by one, more humanoid-faced crabs emerged, encircling Gu Fuyou completely.
Gu Fuyou screamed shrilly, and they screamed back even louder. The more desperately Gu Fuyou screamed, the fiercer their response.
Their haunting cries were enough to shatter one’s sanity.
Zhong Michu stood to the side, looking quite irritated by the commotion.
Gu Fuyou looked desperately at Zhong Michu, her voice trembling with a sobbing tone, “Senior Sister Zhong, save me!”
Zhong Michu calmly responded, “Humanoid-faced crabs, they don’t harm people.”
Gu Fuyou yelled back, “But they’re so disgusting!”
Why did all sorts of demons and monsters flock to her?
Just seeing those human faces on the crabs gave her the chills. Just touching one sent a cold shiver from her feet to her head. She wished she could just cut off the limbs that had touched the creepy crabs.
However, Zhong Michu showed no intention of helping. Her sleeves billowed in the breeze, her hair entwined with a ribbon, as she gazed at the blue sky and the sea, looking as if she was leisurely enjoying the scenery, oblivious to the urgency.
Gu Fuyou felt that Zhong Michu was still holding a grudge because she had summoned her just before her bath and had clung to her legs, refusing to let her go, which was why she was now watching indifferently.
As the humanoid-faced crabs continued to advance, Gu Fuyou had no choice but to back into the sea.
She was terrified by the countless humanoid-faced crabs, but she tried to reassure herself. If she just closed her eyes and ran through them, treating them like stepping stones, she could reach Zhong Michu’s side.
However, she found herself paralyzed by fear, on the verge of breaking down, “Nanzhu Jun!”
Zhong Michu’s gaze darted over, her expression unfriendly.
Gu Fuyou remembered her promise not to force Zhong Michu to do anything, so she quickly changed her tone and said softly, “Senior Sister Zhong…”
“Good Senior Sister… Sister! Dear sister!”
After she pleaded several times, Zhong Michu appeared momentarily surprised.
Gu Fuyou continued, “Use your divine powers, please…”
Before she could finish, the sea behind her suddenly rippled. The next instant, a slender white figure burst through the water, coiling around Gu Fuyou’s waist and swiftly dragging her away.
Gu Fuyou was pulled into the air, screaming, “Zhong Michu ahhhhhh!” Her voice changed pitch in panic, rising and falling as it grew more and more distant.
Chapter 9
Unlucky Encounter
Gu Fuyou saw a swaying dark shadow beneath the rippling waves and realized that the thing entangling her must be the tail of a sea spirit beast.
Her hands were free, so she opened her storage bag, searching for a talisman that might be useful.
Suddenly, a wave several meters high surged ahead of the spirit beast. This was not a natural wave, but one created by a slash of sword energy, stirring up a massive snow wave.
Looking back, Gu Fuyou saw Zhong Michu rushing to her aid.
The spirit beast halted its escape and surfaced, revealing its form—a silver armored body with pincers sharper than blades
Gu Fuyou gasped, “A sea scorpion.”
She immediately recoiled, distancing her body from the deadly tail.
The tail hook of the sea scorpion was highly venomous. For a cultivator of her level, if she accidentally got poisoned, within three hours, her whole body would turn purple and swell, the wound would fester, and she would die from qi exhaustion.
The very thought of such a gruesome death was unbearable.
Despite its fear of Zhong Michu, the sea scorpion seemed reluctant to release Gu Fuyou, considering her a delectable treat. It brandished its massive claw in a threatening manner, but its posture, with claws outstretched like a person crossing their arms, appeared more like a sign of submission.
As Gu Fuyou observed the movements of the sea scorpion’s large claws, she suddenly remembered something she had read—sea scorpions are always found in pairs, male and female together. Having never seen one before, she wasn’t sure if this was true.
Gu Fuyou always felt a trace of unease in her heart, and this unease soon became a reality.
From behind Zhong Michu, a white shadow surged from the water – the tail of another sea scorpion, aiming directly at Zhong Michu’s back.
She saw a white shadow burst from the water behind Zhong Michu—it was the tail of another sea scorpion, its venomous hook aimed directly at Zhong Michu’s back.
Indeed, there were two! The one entangling her was larger, likely the male, while the one attacking Zhong Michu was the female!
Panicking, Gu Fuyou shouted, “Zhong Michu, behind you!”
Zhong Michu remained unflustered, nimbly dodging aside as a water column rose from the sea, steadying her stance.
With her left hand controlling the sword, its light flashed, and Gengchen moved swiftly to Gu Fuyou’s side. The blade spun, severing the dreaded poison hook before the male scorpion could even react. Her right hand lifted, and from the sea rose a gigantic hand formed of condensed water, gripping the lurking female scorpion.
The female scorpion could also be considered imposing and fiercely intimidating, but once caught by the water shaped hand, it froze, not daring to struggle at all, like a cat grabbed by the back of its neck.
Zhong Michu subdued her enemy with these two moves without a single strand of her hair being disturbed.
This was the first time Gu Fuyou had seen Zhong Michu truly exert her power in combat.
At that moment, to Gu Fuyou, Zhong Michu seemed like a celestial descended to Earth, unparalleled in beauty and might. Everything else paled in comparison.
Overwhelmed with excitement, Gu Fuyou felt her blood rush to her head, her body tingling with delight, her eyes sparkling. She forgot they were still in danger and cheered, “Senior Sister Zhong, that was amazing! You’re incredible!”
Zhong Michu turned back to look at Gu Fuyou, her gaze carrying a complex mix of emotions. Gengchen, initially poised to sever the tail of the sea scorpion to rescue Gu Fuyou, suddenly paused.
In a split second of hesitation, the sea scorpion entangling Gu Fuyou, sensing it was overpowered, seized the opportunity to dive deeper into the ocean in an attempt to escape.
Zhong Michu, with fluid motion, summoned her sword, Gengchen, back to her side and dove into the water after it.
Underwater, she moved with a grace and speed unexpected for someone accustomed to land, easily outpacing the sea creature in its own territory.
In a flurry of panic, the sea scorpion swiftly cast Gu Fuyou to the left while it darted to the right, fervently seeking its last chance to escape.
Zhong Michu glided through the water with the grace of a fish, reaching Gu Fuyou effortlessly and in an instant.
The force of the sea scorpion’s throw had sent Gu Fuyou tumbling, her head pointing downwards toward the seabed and her feet up towards the surface. Earlier, she had opened her storage bag in search of an escape talisman, only to see it now shut.
Now floating upside down, the talismans and spirit stones from her storage bag drifted around her, suspended in the water.
As Gu Fuyou reached out to grab the talismans, a sudden force enveloped her waist. For a moment, she feared the sea scorpion had returned.
But the force righted her, allowing her to see clearly that it was not the sea scorpion but Zhong Michu who had grasped her waist.
In the briefest of moments, a sensation overwhelmed Gu Fuyou, and before she could fully comprehend, she found herself and Zhong Michu both floating upside-down again in the water.
Only moments before, they had been upright, nearly touching the muddy seabed.
Now, not only were they floating in the sea without sight of the seabed, but they were also inverted, surrounded by a tranquil and eerie blue, silent, with nothing but the floating talismans nearby.
Looking into the distance, the blue deepened, swallowed by darkness. This lifeless place bore no resemblance to the shallow sea scenery they had left behind; it was more akin to the deep sea.
Gu Fuyou blew a couple of bubbles and gestured to Zhong Michu.
It was a teleportation formation; they had unwittingly stood on one.
Unluckily, her storage bag had been open, and the spirit stones had fallen out, activating the formation and bringing them here.
Now, they were unsure where they had been transported.
Gu Fuyou thought that this place couldn’t be too terrible. Despite her own bad luck, she believed the heavens wouldn’t be so cruel to someone as favored as Zhong Michu.
Lost in thought, she was soon snapped back to reality when Zhong Michu grabbed her arm, repositioned her, and then summoned her spiritual power to ascend to the surface.
After bursting through the sea surface, Zhong Michu lifted her sleeve, and Gengchen transformed into a streak of sword light, carrying them to the shore.
Once on land, they realized they were no longer near the cliffs they remembered. While the coastline still had a beach, beyond it lay an endless desert, where the golden sands seemed to meld with the horizon.
It appeared that stepping into the teleportation formation had transported them to another part of the sea, but not the same region.
Gu Fuyou collapsed onto the ground, coughing repeatedly; they had emerged too hastily and she had choked on some water.
After catching her breath, she opened her hand, revealing the wet talisman she had managed to grab.
The soaked talisman was now damaged and rendered useless. The rest of her talismans and the spirit stones, along with the precious medicines in her storage bag, had sunk to the ocean floor. All that remained in her bag was a piece of meat and a cherished sword embryo.
Despondently, Gu Fuyou lay on the ground, her vibrant colors seemingly drained, her spirit appearing grey and defeated.
She had spent three whole months crafting those talismans!
Ancient texts had always called the runes on talismans ‘the language of the gods,’ claiming they had the power to suppress evil and expel demons. In reality, these talismans were merely vessels for spells and formations, a type of magical instrument.
In order to conserve spiritual energy and for convenience, cultivators developed talismans as magical instruments, storing various spells and formations within them. When used, these talismans do not consume any spiritual energy but simply invoke their attributes to manifest their power.
The activation of these talismans simply required spoken words, emphasizing the power of language. In ancient times, this phenomenon was termed “Yan Ling” or “Spirit of the Word.”
In short, talismans are useful, but they also have disadvantages: they can only be used once, are easily damaged, and are extremely vulnerable to water, which invariably ruins them.
Zhong Michu brushed off her clothes, appearing as if not a single drop of water clung to her, clean and neat after swimming around in the sea.
She noticed the expression on Gu Fuyou’s face and saw her still sitting on the ground without getting up. Hesitating for a moment, she asked, “Are you hurt?”
Gu Fuyou, looking as if the soul had been drained from her, clutched the ruined talisman, murmuring with a sense of loss, “My talismans… haha, I spent over three months crafting them…”
Day and night, she had worked tirelessly to make her journey into Xian Luo a bit easier, and to be able to help Si Miao and Gu Huaiyou.
Zhong Michu glanced at the scattered talismans on the ground. Even in their damaged state, the inscriptions were faintly visible. Although not an expert in artifact crafting or formations, she was knowledgeable enough to recognize their significance.
While these talismans were single-use, seeing the quantity made it evident that crafting them was no easy feat. Their destruction was indeed a pity.
Moreover, some of the talismans were particularly rare, and to think that they were crafted in just three months left Zhong Michu quite surprised.
She then turned her attention to Gu Fuyou, who looked utterly devastated, as if she wished the earth would swallow her. Feeling guilty, Zhong Michu mused that had she acted more decisively, Gu Fuyou wouldn’t have fallen into the ocean, and her talismans would be intact.
After a moment of contemplation, Zhong Michu carefully said, “Don’t worry. I made a promise to you, and I will not go back on my word.”
Gu Fuyou did not respond, and after a moment of silence, Zhong Michu added, “I’m familiar with the spells on these talismans. If you need to use them, let me do it.”
Gu Fuyou looked up at her, her face pale from the cold seawater, the tip of her nose slightly red, her eyes irritated and rimmed with red, making them appear watery.
She was slightly dazed, partly because she hadn’t recovered from the shock of the talismans being destroyed, and partly because she didn’t quite understand the meaning of Zhong Michu’s sudden offer.
Zhong Michu, intending to comfort Gu Fuyou and seeing her reaction, thought that perhaps Gu Fuyou doubted her sincerity.
Thus, she didn’t say much more, simply waved her sleeve, creating a breeze from nowhere. This was controlling the wind: the wind whipped up the sand, howling as it formed a small tornado and moved deeper into the desert.
Zhong Michu then twisted her wrist and lifted a flame in her palm. This was controlling fire: with a gentle toss, it exploded brilliantly, like a fiery lotus, scorching the sand beside it black.
Zhong Michu then chose a few of the spells from Gu Fuyou’s ruined talismans and demonstrated them.
Finally, Zhong Michu lightly tapped her finger, and a bolt of purple lightning exploded behind Gu Fuyou, startling her back to her senses.
This was the spell from the talisman Gu Fuyou held in her hand. The talisman for summoning lightning was difficult to refine, especially for a cultivator of Gu Fuyou’s level.
Only then did Gu Fuyou realize that Zhong Michu was trying to comfort her. Was she actually comforting her?
Indeed, Gu Fuyou had visited the Gushen Peak more than a dozen times and felt that Zhong Michu was not difficult to get along with. Although Zhong Michu was typically aloof and unapproachable, she never troubled anyone.
But when Zhong Michu chose to ignore someone, she really could be terse—speaking no more than necessary and ignoring others when possible.
Now, seeing her taking the effort to comfort her was indeed surprising.
Gu Fuyou hadn’t had time to fully appreciate this surprise when she belatedly noticed something else. She shifted to look at the scorched pit created by the lightning, and asked in astonishment, “Did you just summon lightning?”
Zhong Michu simply replied, “Yes.”
Gu Fuyou stared at her in disbelief, “You don’t have a mutated thunder spirit root, and normally, mastering such a technique would require reaching the Nascent Soul stage in your cultivation. How could you possibly…”
How could you know thunder techniques!
Seeing her unspoken question, Zhong Michu answered, “It came naturally.”
“Naturally…” Gu Fuyou replied with a stiff smile.
She had used countless spirit stones and beast cores, and blown up her furnace multiple times, spending over a month to craft just one lightning summoning talisman. Meanwhile, Zhong Michu merely flicked her finger and summoned a bolt of lightning.
It was a level of talent far beyond the ordinary, and Gu Fuyou couldn’t help but feel envious.
Zhong Michu’s casual remark of “naturally” made Gu Fuyou’s teeth itch with irritation.
Swept up in the realization of the immense divide between their abilities, a wave of discouragement washed over Gu Fuyou. But in a sudden burst of emotion, she lunged at Zhong Michu, hugging her tightly around the legs, exclaiming, “Ahhh! I don’t care, you’re all mine now!”
Caught off guard, the typically composed Zhong Michu blurted out, “What are you doing?!”
After a brief struggle, Gu Fuyou released her.
After this brief commotion, Gu Fuyou seemed to push the issue of the talismans out of her mind, rejuvenated. She stood up, straightened her clothes, and looked around. The sea on one side, the desert on the other, both stretched endlessly.
At this point, Gu Fuyou just wanted to find her way back to the barren forest, but after two teleportations, she was completely disoriented. 
These formations were all one-way, concerned only with arrival and not return, making it nearly impossible to go back the way they came. Moreover, while the spiritual energy here was dense, it flowed very slowly, likely meaning there were no transport-type formations available.
Right now, they could only move forward, taking things one step at a time.
Initially, the two had a choice: they could head towards the sea or move into the desert.
But since Gu Fuyou was human, not fish, she couldn’t just walk on water. Although the desert wasn’t ideal, at least she could walk there, so she felt more secure on land and chose to head towards the desert.
Zhong Michu, having been abruptly embraced twice, had her face flush with embarrassment, which faded to a stony expression as she no longer spoke to Gu Fuyou or acknowledged her decision.
As Gu Fuyou prepared to walk, Zhong Michu summoned her sword, Gengchen, and they proceeded deeper into the desert.
They traveled for an unknown amount of time, and still, the desert seemed endless.
Sand and wind obscured their vision, the world around them a dull yellow haze.
Gu Fuyou thought about asking Zhong Michu to come down so they could walk for a while. Given the unpredictable dangers within this Xian Luo, and considering that Zhong Michu was their primary force, she needed to conserve her spiritual energy for emergencies.
But before she could voice this thought, Gengchen suddenly plummeted downward as if pulled by something on the ground.
Caught off guard, Gu Fuyou almost fell, but in a panic, she clung to Zhong Michu’s waist from behind.
Unable to control Gengchen and distracted by Gu’s embrace, the sword slipped from under them. As it threatened to be consumed by the sandy ground, Zhong Michu summoned it back, and Gengchen transformed into a beam of light, returning to her sleeve.
Without the sword, they fell from the sky. Zhong Michu conjured wind to cushion their descent, preventing them from a harsh landing.
Still shaken, Gu Fuyou brushed her chest and asked, “What just happened?”
Zhong Michu stared coldly at her for a while. Gu Fuyou suddenly remembered that Zhong Michu wasn’t accustomed to overly affectionate gestures. In the short time she had been with her, Gu Fuyou had already hugged her legs and waist. She felt fortunate that she wasn’t a man, or her fate might have been rather grim.
Embarrassed by her gaze, Gu Fuyou mumbled, “I almost fell, so I…”
Zhong Michu withdrew her gaze and slowly explained, “It seems there’s a magnet underground that pulled the sword down.”
“So, what do we do now?”
“The magnetic force is strong, and Gengchen is frightened. We can’t use the sword to fly anymore.”
Gu Fuyou was surprisingly okay with this: “If we can’t use the sword, then we can’t. I actually wanted to suggest walking anyway, so this works out.”
She spoke casually, unconcerned about the inability to fly. Zhong Michu didn’t comment further, and from then on, they continued on foot.
But Gu Fuyou hadn’t anticipated that the magnetic field underground was extensive. Despite walking for a long time, they were still unable to use the sword.
Time within Xian Luo did not align with the outside world, where days and nights alternate. Here, the sun might not set for several days, or the stars might dominate the sky for equally long periods.
Though she wasn’t sure exactly how many days they had walked, Gu Fuyou felt it must have been at least five.
By now, she was famished and exhausted.
Zhong Michu, being akin to a demi-immortal who doesn’t require grain to sustain her energy, was unaffected. But Gu Fuyou, still mortal flesh, albeit stronger than an average person, still felt hunger and fatigue.
Unfortunately, Gu Fuyou’s stored food and magical artifacts had previously fallen into another part of the sea.
With no food, Gu Fuyou grew dizzy from hunger. She looked up at the sky, where the sun blazed through a haze of yellow dust, and felt a wave of dizziness so intense that she collapsed to the ground.
Hearing the commotion, Zhong Michu, who had been walking ahead, turned and called out, “Gu Fuyou?”
As Zhong Michu approached, Gu Fuyou lifted her head and saw Zhong Michu’s hand extended towards her. The hand was as delicate and creamy as sheep’s milk cheese. Given that Zhong Michu possessed a water spirit root, her entire being radiated a refreshing, moist aura.
Blinded by her hunger, Gu Fuyou’s gaze fixated on that hand. Her mind wandered to the sweet lotus roots in Xiaoyao City, which were crispy and fragrant with each bite, and to the pear-flavored dairy desserts from Yinxue Pavilion, bursting with creamy goodness.
In a moment of sheer impulse and overpowering hunger.
Gu Fuyou bit into Zhong Michu’s hand.
Zhong Michu: “…”
Gu Fuyou: “…”
Chapter 10
Against All odds
Gu Fuyou slowly came back to her senses in a daze, her eyes meeting with Zhong Michu’s. Seeing Zhong Michu’s ever-changing expression, she realized what she had done.
She released her bite, silently lay down, turned her back to Zhong Michu, and covered her face with her hands, feeling deeply ashamed and humiliated.
Like someone trying to escape from reality, she recited a list of comfort foods under her breath, “Candied pork knuckle, soy sauce duck breast, braised beef with soybeans, steamed bass, sweet rice pumpkin, date and osmanthus cake, and a cup of crisp tea…”
Behind her, Zhong Michu stood silently, staring at her own palm.
She understood that Gu Fuyou’s spiritual cultivation had its limits, and that she had reached her breaking point. After a moment’s hesitation and a heavy sigh, Zhong Michu offered, “If you can’t walk anymore… I’ll carry you.”
Gu Fuyou’s eyes widened in shock, much like earlier when Zhong Michu had unexpectedly comforted her. This was surprising because Zhong Michu typically avoided physical contact, especially with her, often stepping back to maintain distance.
Gu Fuyou turned her head, peeking through her fingers with a doubtful look. Although she was skeptical, she had never seen Zhong Michu joke.
“You don’t want to?”
“I do!”
Gu Fuyou immediately sat up. She was really too tired to move.
Zhong Michu swept up her long sleeves, turned around, and squatted in front of her.
Quickly, Gu Fuyou climbed onto her back, fearing that if she delayed, Zhong Michu might change her mind.
Once Gu Fuyou was securely on her back, Zhong Michu rose to her feet. Knowing that Zhong Michu disliked being touched, Gu Fuyou respectfully rested her hands on Zhong Michu’s shoulders without holding her tightly.
Zhong Michu walked with such steadiness that there was no jostling at all. Seeing Zhong Michu still barefoot, Gu Fuyou felt a pang of guilt.
She reached up to tuck a strand of hair behind her ear and nervously touched her earlobe before speaking up, “Senior Sister Zhong, I didn’t mean to summon you while you were taking a bath. I’m sorry.”
Zhong Michu responded indifferently, “I know.”
“I also didn’t mean to hug your waist… and legs…” Although she admitted that grabbing Zhong Michu’s legs the previous times had been intentional, it was out of desperation and lack of control.
“Hmm.”
“You’re still barefoot. If you don’t mind, you can wear my shoes.” Gu Fuyou estimated their foot sizes to be similar.
As she spoke, she bent her leg back to remove her shoe.
Zhong Michu responded, “No need.”
“Okay…”
Following that, a prolonged silence ensued.
Normally, even if Zhong Michu didn’t respond, Gu Fuyou, who was never at a loss for words, would have plenty to say. But since entering the realm of Xian Luo, with one ordeal after another, she was truly exhausted.
Not speaking was boring, so she looked around. Seeing only the undulating sand dunes, she shifted her gaze back to Zhong Michu, observing her.
Zhong Michu moved gracefully, her figure slender. Gu Fuyou mused that Zhong Michu’s delicate shoulders weren’t much broader than her own.
Lost in thought, she was jolted awake by a sudden noise, sitting up straight. She looked around in confusion, realizing she had unknowingly fallen asleep on Zhong Michu’s shoulder.
The sky thundered in succession, and Gu Fuyou looked up to see the world changing color. A cold wind howled, dark clouds gathered, and white streaks of lightning danced between them. It looked as if the apocalypse was upon them.
Gu Fuyou had just awakened, her mind still in a daze, “Senior Sister Zhong, did you summon the thunder?”
As soon as she asked, she knew something was wrong.
As Gu Fuyou looked ahead, the endless sand dunes had given way to dark brown soil, lush green grass, and gentle hills.
They had finally escaped the desert, but before she could rejoice, a strong wind blew. To her surprise, Zhong Michu lost her footing and fell backwards.
Originally, Zhong Michu had been standing on a slope with soil in front and sand behind her.
When she fell backwards, she let go of Gu Fuyou. Although Gu Fuyou also stumbled and fell, Zhong Michu didn’t land on her. Fortunately, they fell onto sand, so neither was hurt too badly.
Neither of them got up immediately; instead, they just lay against the sand.
Overwhelmed by shock, Gu Fuyou stared blankly ahead and asked Zhong Michu, “Zhong… Senior Sister Zhong, what are those? Am I seeing things?”
What she had hastily seen at the end of the wilderness were two giant beasts of extraordinary size. One had gray mane and raised its head to roar at the sky, while the other had wings on its back and looked down upon the earth.
The two gigantic creatures stood facing each other, tense and bristling with spiritual energy. Even from a distance, hidden behind a sand dune, Gu Fuyou could feel the intense vibrations.
Covering her rapidly beating heart, with her hands shaking from fear, she confirmed that what she saw was real.
As she started to speak, the cold air caught in her throat, “Senior Sister Zhong, those two spirit beasts… they have attained the Golden Core Stage, right?”
Zhong Michu’s face turned pale, and she clenched her fist, replying slowly, “I’m afraid they’re beyond Hollow Void Stage.”
“…”
For a moment, Gu Fuyou’s mind went blank, then she laughed stiffly, “Hehehe, beyond Hollow Void…”
She understood the concept “beyond Hollow Void,” the stages above Golden Core are: Nascent Soul, Hallow Void, Soul Splitting, and Immortalization. This means these creatures are two major stages above Zhong Michu. Even the sect leader of Xuan Miao Sect is only at the Hallow Void stage.
These two spiritual beasts possessed the strength of elders in any high-ranking immortal sect.
While the outer layers of Xian Luo are dangerous, there’s no way they would harbor such powerful spirit beasts. Even in the middle layer, such beasts would be rare, let alone two appearing at once.
Gu Fuyou closed and opened her eyes again, but the gloomy sky remained, with roaring thunders and howling winds. All of it was real.
“This must be the ‘unluckiest under heaven, unparalleled in misfortune through the ages.'”
The teleportation formation they had stepped onto at the bottom of the sea had actually transported them directly to the inner layer!
In the chaotic wind, Gu Fuyou’s mind went blank.
If it were the middle layer, even with Zhong Michu beside her, escaping would be extremely dangerous. But in this inner layer, they were probably at the very bottom of the food chain.
It took a while for Gu Fuyou to gather her wits, and she sighed deeply.
Crying and screaming were useless now; They had to face whatever came their way. She rolled over and climbed back to the top of the slope.
On the top of this dirt slope, a few weeds grew sparsely. Hidden behind them, someone sneakily stuck their head out, their bright, dark eyes intently watching the two massive beasts every move in the distance.
Soon, Zhong Michu, who was a few steps away from Gu Fuyou, also peered into the distance.
“Do you think they’ll notice us?” Despite the distance from the two giant beasts, Gu Fuyou whispered, fearing she might be overheard.
At this moment, except for her slightly pale face, Zhong Michu looked normal again, “Even if they did, they wouldn’t care about us.”
Gu Fuyou gave a thoughtful nod. With the two spirit beasts confronting each other and seemingly evenly matched. The air around them crackled with an uncanny energy, a prelude to a cataclysmic showdown that, she sensed, would not end until one of them dies. They wouldn’t have the capacity to focus on anything else.
As Gu Fuyou took a closer look, she finally saw clearly what these two gigantic beasts really were.
What she saw was astonishing.
On the ground was a robust creature with a narrow, elongated jaw sharp fangs, and claws, resembling a wolf. Above, another creature soared, boasting a pair of wings, the body of a lion, and the talons of an eagle.
Perhaps the two spirit beasts were battling over territory or considering the other as prey. Regardless, their confrontation unfolded like an elegant yet perilous dance of blades, with each movement as precise and deadly as a dagger dueling a sword.
The moment the fight began, lightning flashed, and thunder roared, and rain become violent.
At the far end of the grassland, there was a winding river from which dozens of water spouts shot up into the sky like giant dragons, sweeping towards the beast on the ground.
Lightning bolts streaked through the sky, their deafening crashes as if tearing the heavens apart. When the lightning struck, the blinding white light was so intense it was hard to keep one’s eyes open.
Yet Gu Fuyou stared intently at the two spirit beasts, her eyes shining with excitement. “Longxi Shui and White Thunder — that’s a Wind Beast and Zhenmao!” she exclaimed.
Having seen their appearance alone, Gu Fuyou might have been uncertain about their identities. But now, observing their unique attacks, she was confident.
The so-called Longxi Shui is a tornado over water, enveloped by a mist, forming a water spout that reaches up to the sky, resembling a dragon absorbing water.
This technique was the Wind Beast’s favorite move, and only those of the Nascent Soul Stage or above could perform it.
As for the White Thunder, its name described it perfectly, was white lightning. While cultivators typically summon purple or blue lightning, only Zhenmao can summon white lightning.
This spirit beast, Zhenmao, has a unique talent and ability — it can summon lightning, swallow it, and store it.
After cultivators achieve the Golden Core Stage, they must survive the lightning tribulation to ascend to higher realms. If they are not careful and fail to withstand the lightning, the worst-case scenario is their soul scattering, and in less severe cases, they will lose their cultivation levels.
Having a Zhenmao by one’s side provides a layer of protection during these tribulations.
In the past, spirit beasts like the Zhenmao were plentiful outside of Xian Luo. However, because of their excellent innate talents, their cultivation ceiling reaching the Soul Splitting Stage, and their ability to assist cultivators during lightning tribulations, many cultivators captured them to keep as contracted spirit beasts.
There’s nothing wrong with this; anything that flies in the sky or runs on the ground, if powerful enough, people will want to capture and keep it.
However, the Zhenmao’s weakness was its overwhelming pride.How could they willing to bow down as a dog?
When they are young and ignorant, it’s not a problem, but once they mature and their temperament becomes apparent, they become resentful due to the lack of freedom, leading them to seek death or go mad.
Sadly, even knowing the cause of the Zhenmao’s suicides and madness, the cultivators did not stop hunting them.
They reasoned that Zhenmaos have strong reproductive abilities, birthing several offspring at a time with a high survival rate, so losing a few didn’t matter much. If they didn’t capture them, others would, and not capturing them would be a missed opportunity!
As a result, the hunting continued relentlessly until, thousands of years ago, this once-thriving species was driven to extinction outside Xian Luo.
The cultivation levels of these two spirit beasts were rare, and considering their species, they were even rarer.
It was clear why Xian Luo was considered a treasure trove.
Gu Fuyou, engrossed in the battle, had already cast aside her previous fears. A rush of excitement overcame her, even forgetting about her safety.
Suddenly, Zhenmao pounced, taking a fierce bite out of the Wind Beast, and almost tearing it in half with a swipe of its claw. In retaliation, the Wind Beast snapped back viciously, biting Zhenmao’s neck, causing blood to gush out.
Both beasts inflicted fatal wounds on each other, and after a tense standoff, the Wind Beast was the first to fall, crashing to the ground. Zhenmao, standing tall, soon also collapsed, barely clinging to life.
The rain stopped, and the wind calmed. The grasslands, once ravaged by thunderstorms, were scorched black. The earth cracked open, and ancient trees turned to dust.
Gu Fuyou waited a little longer. The Wind Beast showed no signs of life, while the Zhenmao lay on the ground, whining pitifully, unable to stand.
Fearing other spiritual beasts might be drawn by the scent of blood, Gu Fuyou took a deep breath, stood up from behind the slope, and with a determined gaze, walked quickly toward the two spirit beasts, eventually running.
Having the core essences of two spiritual beasts with Hollow Void cultivation levels presented before her was a stroke of extraordinary fortune, the kind you might encounter only once in a lifetime.
Despite the potential danger that the spirit beasts might rally for a last desperate counterattack, Gu Fuyou resolutely continued forward. She was determined to obtain the inner core of the Wind Beast, no matter what.
The Zhenmao lay on the only intact patch of grass in the field, its fresh blood staining the vibrant green a stark red. The beast was still breathing, its chest rising and falling, drawing shaky breaths.
When Gu Fuyou was about ten steps away, the Zhenmao suddenly lifted its head and growled threateningly at her!
At first glance, one might mistake the Zhenmao for a wolf due to its similar appearance.
Its white fangs were bared, blood dripping over its lower lip, its beastly pupils narrowed to slits, and the mane on its neck bristled.
The overpowering aura of a creature in the Hallow Void Stage was terrifying, and even in its dying moments, it shouldn’t be underestimated.
Gu Fuyou’s legs went weak, and she involuntarily stepped back, bumping into something firm, warm, and fragrant.
She turned around to find Zhong Michu standing right behind her.
Gu Fuyou had run over without regard for caution, and Zhong Michu, without saying a word, had silently followed her.
Just as Gu Fuyou was about to apologize, she saw Zhong Michu step aside, not looking at her but instead watching the Zhenmao.
Following Zhong Michu’s gaze, Gu Fuyou looked back at the beast. The previously aggressive creature, which had bared its teeth at her, now appeared much gentler when looking at Zhong Michu.
The Zhenmao’s head drooped weakly, its pupils returning to their normal round shape, letting out a short mournful cry at Zhong Michu.
Gu Fuyou’s eyes moved back to Zhong Michu and saw her expression change slightly, her eyebrows knitting together in a troubled expression.
Gu Fuyou asked, “What’s wrong?”
Zhong Michu walked over and stopped in front of the Zhenmao, saying, “It’s pregnant.”
Gu Fuyou, fearing that the Zhenmao might suddenly bite, moved around from behind Zhong Michu to the belly of the Zhenmao, where she indeed saw an unusual bulge.
Zhong Michu’s expression remained troubled as she whispered, “It’s begging me to help it give birth.”
In Xian Luo, it was the natural order for the strong to prey on the weak. The two spirit beasts had neighboring territories. The Zhenmao became pregnant, but tragically lost its mate.
The cunning Wind Beast had been observing for months, waiting for the Zhenmao to give birth. At its weakest point, it planned to kill the Zhenmao and take its core to further its own cultivation.
But as it is said, a mother’s desperation knows no bounds. The Zhenmao, in order to protect its unborn child from becoming prey, desperately fought the Wind Beast during its labor.
Regrettably, even though it eliminated a significant threat, the Zhenmao was exhausted to the point of death. With its cub still inside, it no longer had the strength to give birth.
Zhong Michu looked down, a look of sorrow on her face, “This is the last Zhenmao in Xian Luo.”
If it dies, there will no longer be such a spirit beast in the world.
Gu Fuyou said, “Then let’s help it.”
Zhong Michu shook her head, struggling, “I… don’t know how…”
Even though she had read countless books, she had never encountered such a situation before. No one had mentioned anything like this to her. She was at a loss.
After a moment, Zhong Michu closed her eyes, sighing, “Forget it.” Taking a deep breath, upon reopening her eyes, summoned Gengchen with a wave of her hand. Her expression determined as she gazed at Zhenmao’s belly.
Gu Fuyou stopped her, “Wait, wait, wait, you’re going to cut it open to deliver the baby?”
Zhong Michu replied, “It’s the only way.”
“But what if you harm the babies inside?” Gu Fuyou asked.
Once Gu Fuyou said this, Zhong Michu’s face showed hesitation, and Gu Fuyou realized she truly was uncertain.
Gu Fuyou pondered for a moment, then rolled up her sleeves, “I’ve read some medical books. Although the method is for delivering foals, um, Zhenmao… it should be more or less the same, not much difference. Let me try first. If it doesn’t work, you can cut it open.”
“Do you know how to do this?” Zhong Michu looked at Gu Fuyou with a puzzled expression.
Gu Fuyou had already rolled up her sleeves, revealing her delicate, pale arms, and knelt in front of the creature.
Zhong Michu’s gaze was rather obvious. Gu Fuyou’s face turned a slight shade of red as she laughed softly, “When I have free time, I like to read all sorts of things.”
Gu Fuyou took a calming breath, gently stroked the Zhenmao’s belly, found the right spot, and inserted her hand.
Zhong Michu watched from the side, her expression indescribable.
The Zhenmao whimpered softly. Guided by her hand through the warm, sticky channel, Gu Fuyou felt the cubs. She shielded them with her spiritual power and gently adjusted their positions, assisting in their exit from their mother.
There were six cubs in total. Gu Fuyou took out one, and the rest followed suit, sliding out one after the other.
It turned out that a Zhenmao cub in Gu Fuyou’s hand had gotten stuck, blocking the passage and preventing its siblings from coming out.
The other five slid out, each about a foot long, their forms markedly less majestic compared to their mother’s imposing stature.
These five cubs lay motionless in the sticky, bloody fluid, their chests showing no signs of movement.
Zhong Michu went over to check and, after a brief touch, looked towards Gu Fuyou, murmuring, “They’re stillborn…”
It was unclear if these five had suffocated from being trapped inside their mother for too long, or if they were unintentionally injured during the Zhenmao’s fight with the Wind Beast. They were lifeless.
Gu Fuyou looked at the Zhenmao cub in her hands. This one was frailer than its siblings, small enough to fit in her cupped hands, curled up with its eyes closed, its body covered in grayish-white fur, with only its nose and paw pads a soft pink color.
As it breathed in and out, its whole body quivered with each breath.
Because her hands were covered in the sticky fluid from the mother beast’s womb, the little beast mistook her for its mother and gently suckled on her thumb.
Regrettably, after trying for a while without getting any milk, it opened its mouth and let out a cry, sounding like a kitten’s meow.
Out of the six Zhenmao cubs, only this one survived.
In ancient times, the sages named this spirit beast “Zhenmao”. “Zhen” represents the thunder position in the Eight Trigrams, and “Mao” symbolizes the flourishing of all things. The name implies that this this spirit beast was powerful and prosperous for eternity.
Ironically, now, this once-mighty race had dwindled to this one frail Zhenmao cub.
Chapter 11
Blessings
Gu Fuyou walked to Zhenmao with the cub in her arms and gently placed it on the grass.
Zhenmao extended its vivid red tongue to lick the cub from head to tail, then emitted two mournful cries. A tear fell from the corner of its eye as its pupils dilated, and it dropped its head to the ground, falling silent forever.
The cub, still with its eyes closed, was clumsy, scrambling its limbs and crawling like a baby turtle, it seemed to sense something and began to cry out.
The sound was similar to before – high-pitched like a kitten’s mew, but this time it carried an additional undertone of desolation and helplessness.
Gu Fuyou’s heart tightened, her breath catching in her throat. She glanced at the lifeless Zhenmao, her eyes downcast. Picking up the cub, she cradled it in her arms, her thumb stroking the back of its neck. Her voice was low and husky, filled with sadness. “Poor thing, born into this world only to lose its mother…”
Zhong Michu noticed that something was off and asked, “Gu Fuyou?”
Gu Fuyou paused for a moment before turning around, her face still adorned with a bright smile. Holding the cub by its belly, she asked, “Senior Sister Zhong, can I keep it?”
Zhong Michu observed her for a while but didn’t notice anything unusual. Eventually, she replied, “You can.”
Now that the adult Zhenmao was dead, leaving this cub alone in Xian Luo would inevitably result in it becoming prey to other spirit beasts.
Moreover, once in Xianluo, any spirit beast caught on one’s own strength could be kept, and since Gu Fuyou had helped deliver this Zhenmao cub, it could be considered fate. How she wanted to deal with it didn’t actually need Zhong Michu’s permission.
Holding the cub, Gu Fuyou brought it in front of the Zhenmao, allowing it to feed and fill its belly with milk, and she washed her hands in a puddle of rainwater next to the Zhenmao.
Once the cub was satiated, Gu Fuyou stood up, holding it by its front paws and said, “I’ll give you a name.”
“May you be blessed with good fortune, so from now on, I’ll call you Ah Fu…”
Before she could finish, she suddenly heard Zhong Michu shouting, “Gu Fuyou!”
Zhong Michu’s speech was always steady, and this was the first time Gu Fuyou heard her call out in such a sharp, urgent tone.
Before Gu Fuyou could react, she suddenly felt lighter.
Startled, Gu Fuyou looked back, meeting the eyes of a beast. It turned out the Wind Beast wasn’t fully dead. Hanging on to its last breath, it had a moment of resurgence, flapping its wings and rising into the air, grabbing Gu Fuyou with its claws.
Facing a Hallow Void Stage spirit beast was truly terrifying, and Gu Fuyou stiffened, forgetting even to struggle.
Watching the Wind Beast rise into the air, Gu Fuyou came back to her senses and shouted urgently, “Senior Sister Zhong!”
Zhong Michu looked up just in time to see a grey shadow being tossed from Gu Fuyou’s hands. She caught it—it was Ah Fu, whom Gu Fuyou had thrown down.
With Ah Fu cradled in one arm, Zhong Michu summoned Gengchen, riding her sword to give chase.
Though the Wind Beast was injured, it was still a creature of the Hallow Void Stage and could ascend four thousand kilometers in a straight flight, moving extremely fast.
Zhong Michu pursued on her sword but could only see a shadow from a distance.
Gu Fuyou, caught in the beast’s claws, was momentarily stunned with fear. Despite her attempts to stay calm, the cold wind eventually forced her to regain her composure.
She had no talismans on hand, and using her spiritual energy to fight back would be like an ant trying to shake a tree. She struggled a few times, but the claws gripping her waist didn’t budge.
Desperately craning her neck to look behind, she saw no sign of Zhong Michu. She raised her hand to call for help but then let it fall.
Zhong Michu was only at the Golden Core stage. Encountering this Wind Beast would be like Gu Fuyou facing Zhong Michu—utterly powerless to fight back. Even if Zhong Michu understood the way of beast taming, in the face of such an absolute gap in cultivation, those skills would be of little use.
If fate meant for her to die here, summoning Zhong Michu would be pointless. Zhong Michu wouldn’t stand a chance against the Wind Beast and might even lose her life in the process. Why risk it?
As she felt trapped and desperate, her peripheral vision caught a glimpse of something. On closer inspection, she noticed four deep wounds in the Wind Beast’s belly, piercing through its flesh. Through the flesh and blood, she could faintly make out a luminous, pearly white bead nestled deep inside.
It was the Wind Beast’s core!
She had braved the danger to get close to these two dying spirit beasts for this very thing.
Gu Fuyou rallied her spirit, instantly snapping back into action.
The Wind Beast was gravely wounded. Its belly, ripped open by Zhenmao’s claw, exposed the core, completely unguarded.
Gu Fuyou reached out, trying to grab the core, but it was too far away. Even stretching as far as she could, she could only brush the edge of the beast’s belly. She struggled in the grasp of the Wind Beast, wishing her arms were much longer.
Suddenly, an idea struck her. She opened her storage bag and took out the sword embryo from the corner.
Grasping one end of the sword embryo, she took a deep breath. She had to strike swiftly and decisively while the beast was unaware. If it discovered her, she would be crushed to death.
Focusing her energy, a glint of determination flashed in her eyes. With a lightning-fast strike, the sword embryo plunged into the Wind Beast’s body, staying beside the core.
As Gu Fuyou tried to extract the Wind Beast’s core…
The Wind Beast let out a painful cry, clearly sensing her actions. The beast tightened its grip, its already razor-sharp claws digging deeper into Gu Fuyou’s shoulder, causing blood to flow freely.
For some unknown reason, the beast suddenly went berserk, unleashing a deafening roar that seemed to shake the heavens.
Gu Fuyou felt the pressure intensify, nearly suffocating her. The roar reverberated through her chest, sending a tingling numbness through her body.
Fear struck her heart, but she retorted, “You, you, you, think you’re the only one who can scream?”
“AAAAHHHH!” She unleashed a primal scream of her own, matching the Wind Beast’s ferocity. It was partly to bolster her courage, partly to help her exert force. Channeling all her spiritual energy into the sword embryo, she pulled back with all her might.
Finally, the sword embryo managed to pry out the core. The luminous, milky-white core flew into the air, trailing a streak of blood.
Gu Fuyou swiftly reached out with her left hand, just barely managing to grasp it. At that moment, she felt herself plummeting downwards.
The Wind Beast, already at its limit, had lost its final breath with the core gone. Now truly dead, its body began to fall.
As its claws loosened their grip, Gu Fuyou fell free.
“Nanzhu Jun! AAAHHHH!” She had no spiritual energy left to summon help and could only scream.
Zhong Michu was already rushing towards her. Midway there, Gengchen suddenly stopped, refusing to move forward no matter how much she urged it.
Gengchen had sensed a powerful, unfathomable force ahead, one that sent chills down its spine. It wasn’t emanating from the Wind Beast, but from somewhere below. Gengchen refused to let her go any closer.
Zhong Michu had sensed it too, but seeing Gu Fuyou plummeting, she had no time for hesitation.
Zhong Michu dismissed Gengchen and flew on her own. As she looked down, she saw a mountain peak below her.
This peak was strange. The mountain rocks were pitch black, and not a trace of green could be seen on its surface, as if no living thing existed there. At the top of the mountain, a faint glimpse of a blue crystalline object could be seen, looking much like ice.
The closer Zhong Michu got to the mountain, the more she felt her spiritual energy being suppressed. She could barely maintain her position in the wind.
By the time she caught Gu Fuyou, they were already close to the mountain peak.
Zhong Michu’s spiritual power was suppressed to its limit, and the wind was too weak to support both of them. They fell through the large hole at the peak.
Fortunately, Zhong Michu was skilled in both internal and external cultivation. Even with her spiritual energy restricted, her physical strength remained. Holding Gu Fuyou’s waist with one hand and Ah Fu with the other, she used the cliff walls to break their fall, landing safely on the ground.
This sudden descent from the clouds startled Gu Fuyou so much that when her feet touched the ground, her legs gave out, and she knelt on the ground, leaning on the sword embryo.
“You’re injured.”
Gu Fuyou clutched her shoulder. The Wind Beast’s sharp claws had left a deep gash, and blood was already flowing down her arm, staining the sword embryo in her hand and dripping onto the ground, forming a tiny, winding river of red.
“It’s nothing, just some superficial wound. Senior Sister Zhong, are you alright?”
Gu Fuyou looked up to see Zhong Michu crouching beside her. “Give me your hand,” Zhong Michu said, “Let me stop the bleeding.”
Gu Fuyou extended her clean hand. Zhong Michu pressed their palms together, transferring some of her spiritual energy. Though it wasn’t enough to heal Gu Fuyou’s wound completely, it did stop the bleeding.
Ah Fu, who was nestled in Zhong Michu’s arm, suddenly slid off but was quickly caught by Gu Fuyou’s swift reflexes.
Landing on Gu Fuyou’s injured arm, Ah Fu, still with its eyes closed, sniffed around like a little mouse. It extended its pinkish tongue and licked the blood off Gu Fuyou’s hand clean.
Tickled by the sensation, Gu Fuyou laughed and scolded, “You little glutton, you just had ate!”
Zhong Michu glanced at the cub. The little Zhenmao, now full and content, snuggled into Gu Fuyóu’s embrace and settled down.
As the bleeding on Gu Fuyou’s shoulder subsided, Zhong Michu withdrew her hand and rose to her feet.
Gu Fuyou also stood, looking up at the cave ceiling which was about 30 meters high. “Senior Sister Zhong, can you… get us up there?”
Gu Fuyou too had noticed the strange nature of their surroundings. Earlier, when Zhong Michu had been unable to support both of them with the wind, it was clearly due to the suppression of spiritual energy.
Zhong Michu shook her head. Gu Fuyou suggested, “Then we must find another way out.”
The area was filled with an eerie, gloomy aura, making it unsuitable for a prolonged stay. Without wasting any more time, the two of them began searching for an exit.
The walls of the cave were not made of rock but a thick layer of solid ice, the source of the blue and white colors Zhong Michu had seen from the sky.
There were about a dozen passages of varying sizes where they stood, all dark and still, leading into the unknown. Though they needed to find an exit, they had no idea which way to go.
Zhong Michu stood in front of a cave entrance and said, “There’s a breeze here. Let’s try this way.”
Gu Fuyou walked over, circling around to feel for the air current, but was met with confusion. “What breeze…?”
Despite not sensing any wind, she simply assumed her cultivation level was inferior to Zhong Michu’s and thus she couldn’t detect it.
They eventually entered through that opening. The passage was deep and dimly lit. Zhong Michu conjured a ball of flame in her hand to illuminate their path.
The passage twisted and turned, making it impossible to keep track of their direction. However, they could sense they were descending deeper. After an indeterminate amount of time, the path ahead suddenly opened up.
Gu Fuyou glanced ahead and remarked, “It’s a dead end!”
The place was strange. The walls were smooth and even, the ground comprised of three tiered platforms, seemingly crafted by hand. Their path was blocked by a thick wall of ice.
They approached the wall. Gu Fuyóu ran her fingers over the ice, then knocked on it. It emitted a dull thud, indicating considerable thickness, likely impossible to break.
Just as they were resigning themselves to a blocked passage, a tremor ran through the corridor. Gu Fuyou instinctively took two steps back.
With a loud cracking sound, the ice wall before them split open, revealing a passage beyond. What blocked their path was a massive ice door.
Zhong Michu remarked, “The wind is coming from the other side. The exit must be there.”
Gu Fuyóu caught a glimpse of what lay beyond the ice door and frowned. “Senior Sister Zhong, this place feels… off. We should…”
Though instinct screamed danger, urging her to retreat, her body moved forward of its own accord.
Zhong Michu felt the same compulsion. Both of them stepped through the opening, their movements involuntary.
Only when the massive ice door slammed shut behind them with a resounding boom did they snap back to awareness.


Translation notes:
Ah Fu (阿福) – ‘Ah’ (阿) is used as a prefix to indicate familiarity, affection, or endearment. ‘Fu’ (福) means ‘fortune’ or ‘blessing.’ The name ‘Ah Fu’ can be loosely translated to ‘Little Blessing.’ 
Chapter 12
Ruizhu Ice Palace
The place where the two stood resembled a hall. Apart from the door they had entered, there were three other ice doors. All four walls were made of ice, a foot thick, with uneven surfaces. Upon closer inspection, the irregularities on the surface were actually detailed carvings of various birds, each depiction intricate and lifelike.
Despite the lack of any light source, the ice chamber was bright as day.
In the center stood a long platform, also made of ice, its surface etched with elaborate patterns. A woman lay atop the platform, adorned in robes embellished with green feathers and a gold phoenix crown. Her ink-black hair, smooth as silk, cascaded around her.
Surrounding the platform were countless human ice sculptures, all facing the woman. Standing, kneeling, their postures were varied, their expressions vivid—so lifelike they could almost be mistaken for living beings.
Gu Fuyou glanced at a nearby ice sculpture, which depicted a man. She noticed that the sculpture was so detailed it included the accessories on his waist, the ring on his hand, the patterns on his clothes, and even the eyelashes on his eyes. The intricacy was enough to send chills down one’s spine.
It was impossible not to feel that these ice sculptures were living people.
Looking back at the woman on the table, Gu Fuyou felt a surge of inexplicable fear.
The woman’s appearance could be described as “strikingly beautiful.” The corners of her eyes, tipped with a touch of red, were both alluring and seductive. Compared to Zhong Michu, her beauty was of a different kind.
In this icy chamber, her skin was as white as jade, her complexion vibrant, as if she were merely asleep.
Gu Fuyou felt a wave of unease wash over her, a prickling sensation like a dagger pressing against her heart, making it hard to breathe.
But she couldn’t pinpoint the source of this discomfort.
It was as if her mind had become sluggish since entering this place. Only belatedly did she remember they needed to leave. Turning to call out to Zhong Michu…
When she turned around, she saw Zhong Michu not far from her, suddenly collapsing to her knees.
A chill settled in Gu Fuyou’s heart, all her unease exploding at once. She rushed over in two steps to support Zhong Michu, asking, “Senior Sister Zhong, what’s wrong?”
Cold sweat formed on Zhong Michu’s forehead, turning into icy beads before it could roll down her temple. Her body trembled, and after a long moment, she said, “There’s something…”
As she spoke, cold breath escaped her mouth.
Glancing down, Gu Fuyou noticed that Zhong Michu’s legs had started to freeze. Frost was visibly spreading across her body at an alarming pace.
Gu Fuyou was alarmed. Holding the sword embryo in her hand, she swiftly stabbed it into the ground between them. Infusing it with spiritual power, the sword immediately deployed a protective barrier around them..
While the barrier was weak and its light faint, it was better than nothing.
Gu Fuyou knew they couldn’t delay. Seeing those ice sculptures made her even more frightened.
Those people had once been real, likely entering this place by mistake and triggering something that turned them into ice statues.
Zhong Michu had already been afflicted, the frost steadily creeping upwards. Soon, she too would be completely encased in ice, joining the ranks of these frozen statues.
Gu Fuyou asked, “Senior Sister Zhong, did you touch anything?”
Shivering intensely, Zhong Michu managed to grit out, “No…”
She hadn’t touched anything, yet she had been affected without realizing it.
Gu Fuyou felt a cold sweat forming on her forehead. It wasn’t the visible and terrifying enemies that scared her most but the unseen, unknown threats.
In her fear, she dared not act rashly.
Suddenly, a sharp pain shot through Gu Fuyou’s leg, as if she had touched ice and been frozen. She looked down in horror. Her left leg was also turning to ice, the frost creeping upward.
Gu Fuyou took a deep breath of cold air, forcing herself to stay calm.
She had entered with Zhong Michu. They hadn’t touched anything. Yet, Zhong Michu, with her superior cultivation, was the one who got affected first, caught completely off guard.
“It’s a formation,” Gu Fuyou said.
It was likely a restriction-type formation, which activates under specific conditions.
Zhong Michu, a Golden Core cultivator, was powerless against it. Which meant…
Zhong Michu seemed to realize this too. Frost had already covered her hands and cheeks. She said, “It’s… it’s an ancient formation. We can’t break it.”
“Gu Fuyou, if you stay, you’ll… die too. Go, now…”
All she needed to do was cross the long platform, reach the opposite side, and open the large door to escape this dangerous place.
But Zhong Michu’s legs were frozen, her spiritual energy stagnant. She could barely move, let alone escape. Gu Fuyou, however, was far less affected by the freezing. If she were alone, she might be able to make it, to race against time and escape before the frost consumed her entirely.
There were countless types of restrictive formations. Without knowing the triggering condition, Gu Fuyou had no way of knowing what kind of formation this was.Ancient formations typically used rare treasures as their core, making them powerful and long-lasting, extremely difficult to break. Not to mention, she had no clue what kind of formation this was, making it even more impossible to devise a countermeasure.
Gu Fuyou’s mind raced, sifting through every formation record she had ever encountered. She thought so hard her head throbbed, as if on fire.
There was no clue about the type of restrictive formation. Searching for a solution was like finding a needle in a haystack.
“Gu Fuyou, go!” Zhong Michu urged.
Breaking a formation was incredibly difficult. If Gu Fuyou didn’t leave soon, she might not be able to escape either.
But Gu Fuyou seemed not to hear her, her body shivering from the cold. Only her arms felt warm. Looking down, she realized she was still holding Ah Fu.
Seeing Ah Fu’s fluffy body, Gu Fuyou’s eyes lit up.
Ah Fu was completely free of frost. The formation had no effect on it.
Why wasn’t Ah Fu affected? What was different between Ah Fu and her and Zhong Michu?
Gu Fuyou thought of two possibilities: Ah Fu was a spirit beast, different from them, and Ah Fu hadn’t opened its eyes yet.
Ah Fu was just born, hadn’t opened its eyes, and hadn’t seen anything inside.
That’s it! Ah Fu hadn’t seen anything inside!
With this realization, Gu Fuyou recalled a specific type of formation. She stared intently at the woman in the center, wishing she had countless eyes to find the formation’s core. She thought, “Where is it? Where’s the formation core?”
Suddenly, a noise beside her drew her attention. Glancing over, she saw Zhong Michu collapsing to the ground, frost spreading to the corners of her eyes. Her condition deteriorated rapidly, and her breaths grew fainter.
In desperation, Gu Fuyou quickly tucked Ah Fu into the opening of Zhong Michu’s robes, using the fabric to trap the cub’s warmth against Zhong Michu’s chest. “Senior Sister Zhong, hold on!” she cried. “I’ve found a weakness. I can break this formation. Trust me. Please hold on and don’t fall asleep!”
Growing more anxious, beads of sweat formed on Gu Fuyou’s forehead.
She once again forced herself to calm down and search for clues.
Suddenly, it hit her. Gu Fuyou’s eyes snapped towards the long platform beneath the woman, her gaze sharp as lightning.
Without hesitation, she drew the sword embryo. But as she took a step forward, she stumbled and fell. Looking down, she noticed her left leg had frozen up to the knee and her right foot was stiffening, likely beginning to freeze as well.
She picked herself up, using the sword for support, and leaped to the icy platform. Channeling her spiritual energy, she raised her sword and slashed down with all her might.
But even with all her strength, she only managed to create a small crack, and the recoil knocked her to the ground.
Gasping for breath, she knew her spiritual energy wasn’t enough.
Gritting her teeth, she pressed her hand against her shoulder, reopening the wound that had barely begun to clot. Bright red blood began to flow again.
She grabbed the sword embryo, smearing the blade with her own blood.
Cultivators refined their bodies with spiritual energy, and their breath and blood were imbued with this power.
Gu Fuyou knew her spiritual power might still be not enough. She was too weak, only at the Qi Practicing stage. If Zhong Michu were here, she could break it with one strike.
Gu Fuyou bit her lip, feeling a deep, familiar sense of helplessness.
But Zhong Michu couldn’t move and was on the brink of death.
Gu Fuyou closed her eyes, taking a deep breath. When she opened them again, they blazed with determination, not a trace of fear in sight.
If she couldn’t break the core with one strike, she’d strike twice. If that wasn’t enough, she’d strike three times. She’d keep striking until it shattered!
Gathering her strength, Gu Fuyou launched a powerful strike, shouting, “Break!”
She expected another crack, bigger than the last, but instead, the sword embryo erupted with spiritual light. When it struck the table, a web of cracks spread rapidly from the impact point.
In an instant, the entire icy platform collapsed, shattering into fist-sized ice chunks.
With one strike, she broke the formation’s core, and Gu Fuyou was so surprised she froze.
As the platform disintegrated, the woman’s body floated gently to the ground like a feather, still lying there quietly with her eyes closed.
However, Gu Fuyou’s forceful strike had splattered a few drops of her blood on the woman’s face, marring her delicate features.
But Gu Fuyou had no time to worry about that. Her eyes were fixed on a crystal-clear bead, small enough to hold in one hand, among the ice shards. Surrounded by spiritual energy, she knew this was the treasure that served as the formation’s core.
She wrapped it in the handkerchief Zhong Michu had given her earlier and put it in her chest.
Quickly, she hobbled back to Zhong Michu’s side, calling out, “Senior Sister Zhong, I’ve broken the formation. Everything is fine now. I’ll take you out of here!”
Zhong Michu had already closed her eyes, lying motionless on the ground.
Although the formation was broken, it only stopped the ice from spreading further; it didn’t immediately reverse the freezing.
Gu Fuyou called Zhong Michu’s name a couple of times and patted her. When she didn’t respond, Gu Fuyou pulled her up, letting her lean on her shoulder. Using the sword embryo for support, she dragged her towards the large door opposite, murmuring, “It’s okay now. I’ll get you out.”
As they exited through the door, they found themselves in a passageway lined with icy walls, just like before. After taking only a few stumbling steps, the door behind them slammed shut.
Looking back, Gu Fuyou saw a plaque above the door, illuminated by the light from within, with the characters “Ruizhu Palace” inscribed on it.
Gu Fuyou, her own leg frozen, half-carried Zhong Michu, leaning on the sword embryo. They stumbled along until she saw light ahead.
Her eyes brightened as she exclaimed, “Senior Sister Zhong, we’re out! We’re out!”Gu Fuyou gently lowered Zhong Michu to the ground, propping her against the wall.
Zhong Michu remained unconscious, her eyes closed, the frost showing no signs of receding.
Gu Fuyou checked her breathing, which was barely detectable.
Her heart tightened as she lightly patted Zhong Michu’s cheeks, a bit lost, “Zhong Michu, don’t die. Hold on, please.”Ah Fu, lying on Zhong Michu’s chest, was shivering from the intense cold radiating from her body.
Gu Fuyou looked up and noticed blood trickling from Zhong Michu’s nose and the corner of her mouth.
She gasped, instinctively reaching out to wipe it away.
But as she lifted her sleeve, she realized it was covered in grime. The journey through the passage, with its dampness, dirt, and mud, had taken its toll on her clothes.
So, she used her bare hands to wipe away the blood. It wouldn’t stop flowing, staining her entire hand red after a while.
Gu Fuyou wiped her hand clean on her own clothes and continued to clean Zhong Michu’s face. Her hands trembled with urgency, thinking, “Could the cold have damaged her internal organs…”
Eventually, the bleeding stopped, and Zhong Michu’s face was clean, with no trace of blood left.
In contrast, Gu Fuyou’s own clothes were stained with patches of red and black.
Even though the bleeding had stopped, the injury remained, and the frost didn’t dissipate.
Holding onto Zhong Michu’s wrist, Gu Fuyou tried to channel her spiritual energy into her. But with a significant gap in their cultivation levels and her own energy nearly depleted from their recent struggle, her efforts were like trying to douse a cart fire with a cup of water.
In fact, this bit of spiritual energy seemed even less effective than warmth from a fire.
An idea struck her. Grabbing the sword embryo, she slammed it against the icy ground with all her might, shattering the frozen surface. Picking up a shard the size of a bowl, she pressed it against the wound on her shoulder.
She had reopened the wound earlier, causing it to bleed profusely. If she didn’t stop the bleeding, she would collapse, and if she collapsed, they would both die here.
But with her spiritual energy dwindling, she couldn’t afford to waste any. This was the only way.
The sharp pain from the ice and the wound mixed together. Gu Fuyou fell to the ground, curling up tightly, her voice hoarse as she cried out, “Ahhhhh, it hurts! It hurts!” But her grip on the ice never wavered. Only when she felt the blood beginning to clot did she finally let go. Then, she tossed the ice chunk away.
She took off her outer robe and spread it on the ground. Gently, she lowered Zhong Michu on it. Then, she removed her inner robe and draped it over Zhong Michu, tucking her in tightly
Now in only her undergarments, she hopped outside with her frozen leg.
Upon exiting the cave, she found herself halfway up a mountain. The surrounding rocks were charred black, and looking down, the view was a blend of black and red with no other colors.
Gu Fuyou searched around the mountainside, muttering, “There should be one, I saw it.”
After a while, she finally saw a flowering tree ahead. In an area with no other vegetation within ten kilometers, there stood a single tree, its blue blossoms misty and ethereal, like a cloud of purple-blue haze.
It was a jacaranda tree. The story of this tree came to Gu Fuyou’s mind. Amidst the vast, desolate mountains, devoid of any other life, this lone tree stood, evoking a deep sense of loneliness.
The tree on this mountain was sturdy, clearly having grown for many years. She felt a pang of guilt at the thought of cutting it down.
She clasped her hands in front of the tree and whispered, “Forgive me. I’m doing this to save a life.”
With a swift move, she cut the tree in half with her sword embryo, chopped it into firewood, and carried it back to the cave.
Using the last of her spiritual energy, she drove the moisture out of the wood and lit a fire, ensuring it burned brightly.
She approached Zhong Michu, initially hesitant. After a moment, she finally dared to check her pulse. It was still weak but present.
Relieved, Gu Fuyou let out a long sigh and couldn’t help but smile.
Leaning against her sword embryo, she slumped down beside the fire, too exhausted to move any further.
Chapter 13
Stone Maiden Ancient Formation
After a narrow escape from death, Gu Fuyou was exhausted. As she sat by the fire, her eyes grew heavy, feeling like they were glued shut. She leaned against her sword embryo and dozed off for a while.
Time passed indistinctly until the frost covering Zhong Michu began to thaw. Slowly, her eyes fluttered open. As she gazed at the icy ceiling of the cave, she struggled to understand what had occurred.
She closed her eyes again, pondering for a moment before remembering the events before she passed out.
When Zhong Michu opened her eyes again and sat up, the clothes that were covering her slipped off. She grabbed them with one hand, and with a glance, noticed someone beside her. Instinctively, she called out, “Gu Fuyou.”
She turned her head to look, only to see Gu Fuyou sitting next to the fire wearing only her undergarments, with her shoes taken off, revealing a tight waist, toned legs, and well-proportioned feet. Her skin, originally fair, was flushed with a charming warm red under the heat of the flames.
Gu Fuyou’s head kept nodding as she dozed off, looking adorable as she fought sleep.
Zhong Michu was momentarily stunned, unsure of what to say next.
Yet, it was her voice that roused Gu Fuyou. Startled, she sat upright and rubbed her eyes, murmuring, “Senior Sister Zhong.”
Her voice was thick with sleepiness, signaling she hadn’t completely awoken.
Seeing Zhong Michu propped up and looking at her, Gu Fuyou realized she wasn’t imagining things. Zhong Michu was indeed awake.
Gu Fuyou’s heart leaped with joy, and she was fully awake now.
Though she saw that the frost had completely melted from Zhong Michu’s face, the previous sight of her bleeding from the mouth and nose was terrifying. Now, seeing her still pale, Gu Fuyou couldn’t help but worry. “How do you feel? Are you any better?”
Zhong Michu handed the clothes back to her, saying, “I’m fine now. You should put on your clothes first.”
Hearing this, Gu Fuyou felt a bit more at ease. She took the clothes, but when she was about to put them on, she noticed Zhong Michu’s lips twitch slightly, and she turned her head away
Gu Fuyou originally thought that since they were both women, and in this desolate place with no one else around, there was nothing to be shy about undressing to save a life.
She figured that Zhong Michu was strict about etiquette and, being less sociable, might feel uncomfortable even among other girls.
Understanding this, Gu Fuyou felt a bit embarrassed seeing Zhong Michu’s reaction and hurriedly put on her inner garment.
Her outer garment was still under Zhong Michu. After hesitating for a moment, she said, “Senior Sister Zhong, could you please…”
Following her gaze, Zhong Michu realized she was sitting on Gu Fuyou’s clothes. As she moved hurriedly to retrieve them, Ah Fu tumbled out of her arms.
Zhong Michu handed her the clothes, and Gu Fuyou took the outer garment, brushed off the dust, and put it on.
Ah Fu, who had been nearly frozen to death by the frost on Zhong Michu, had just warmed up and fallen asleep. The commotion woke it up, leading to a series of annoyed chirps.
When Gu Fuyou picked up Ah Fu, she was pleasantly surprised to see its eyes open. She couldn’t tell if it was just her imagination, but it seemed to have grown a bit larger as well.
“Senior Sister Zhong, look! Ah Fu has opened its eyes!”
Ah Fu blinked his large, watery eyes at Gu Fuyou, looking a bit dazed. He let out a couple of soft cries.
It felt like he was calling for his mother, making Gu Fuyou so happy that she petted him affectionately. She wanted to show him to Zhong Michu, but Ah Fu kept squirming and rubbing against her shoulder.
Noticing the bloodstain on Gu Fuyou’s shoulder, Zhong Michu’s brows frowned slightly. She knew it was from Gu Fuyou’s wound, which seemed to have scabbed over, but she still asked, “How’s the wound on your shoulder?”
Ah Fu clung to Gu Fuyou’s shoulder, refusing to get down. No matter how Gu Fuyou tried to coax it, Ah Fu wouldn’t budge. Hearing Zhong Michu speak, Gu Fuyou replied, “Huh? Oh, it’s fine now.”
Zhong Michu reached over, grabbed Ah Fu by the scruff of his neck, and lifted him up.
The moment Ah Fu was in Zhong Michu’s arms, he quieted down immediately.
Gu Fuyou was speechless.
With Ah Fu quiet, the cave became silent again. The initial awkwardness from earlier, when she was dressing, seemed to return, making it difficult for Gu Fuyou to speak.
After a long pause, Zhong Michu said softly, “Thank you for saving me.”
Gu Fuyou counted on her fingers and said, “It’s nothing. You’ve saved me many times, Senior Sister Zhong. If we were to compare, I should be the one thanking you.”
Zhong Michu shook her head. “When I saved you, I did so effortlessly. It was nothing. But when you saved me, you risked your life. It’s not the same.”
Gu Fuyou felt embarrassed by her serious words, her smile turning shy. “After all, it was my idea to bring you to Xian Luo, causing all this trouble. I’m just glad you’re not angry with me.”
Zhong Michu stroked Ah Fu’s fur. Ah Fu curled up on her lap, purring softly as he fell asleep again. “Did you break the formation?” Zhong Michu asked.
Recalling the situation, Zhong Michu remembered how they had entered the icy chamber in confusion. As soon as she regained her senses, she was hit by a restriction spell, her legs freezing and making her kneel on the ground. Gu Fuyou was also struck soon after.
If Gu Fuyou had tried to carry her out immediately, they wouldn’t have made it to the door before the formation turned them into ice statues. But now they were safe, indicating that Gu Fuyou had chosen to break the formation first.
Gu Fuyou poked the fire, adding a couple more logs. When she heard the question, she replied casually, “Yeah. It was really close. We almost didn’t make it out.”
Zhong Michu stared intently at Gu Fuyou, the reflection of the firelight making her light-colored eyes shimmer, “How did you find the formation’s weakness?”
Smiling, Gu Fuyou explained, “It was luck. At the time, we were both under the restriction, our bodies frozen. But I noticed that Ah Fu had no frost on him. I wondered what made him different from us and why he wasn’t affected.”
“There were two differences. First, Ah Fu is a spirit beast, and we are humans.”
Zhong Michu’s calm gaze wavered slightly, her hand gently stroking Ah Fu’s back. 
“And the other?”
Gu Fuyou continued, “Second, Ah Fu had just been born and hadn’t opened his eyes yet. Considering the first point, there are some formations targeting specific races, but they are rare. So, I focused on the second point. As it turned out, there is an ancient formation similar to the one in the ice chamber.”
“Senior Sister Zhong, have you heard of the ‘Resentful Woman Formation’?”
Zhong Michu’s brows frowned, unsure if she was pondering what kind of formation it was or why it had such a crude name.
Gu Fuyou continued, “Or you might know it as the ‘Stone Maiden Formation.'”
Suddenly, recognition flashed across Zhong Michu’s face, “I’ve heard of it.”
Legend has it that this formation was created by a couple. This couple, both powerful immortals, were once deeply in love, promising to be together for life.
Unfortunately, people’s hearts are prone to change, and after being together for a long time, they gradually grew apart.
The wife’s celestial beauty, once as enchanting as a fairy, became tiresome to her husband. He began seeking other women.
Initially, the wife hoped to win back his affection. Once, when he went to secretly meet his lover, she invited two of their friends to help persuade him to return.
But the husband, humiliated and angry, argued that many men had multiple wives and concubines. Although he had taken another lover, he hadn’t brought her home. His wife was still his only official spouse, so he felt he wasn’t being too unfaithful.
She, on the other hand, had aired their private affairs to outsiders, which he felt ruined his reputation. Any remaining guilt dissipated, leaving only resentment. He publicly scolded her as a “resentful woman” in front of his lover and their friends, even resorting to physical violence.
The wife was a proud woman who couldn’t tolerate deceit. She had tried to persuade him only for the sake of their long-standing relationship, but his reaction left her heartbroken and resolute.
The deeper the love, the deeper the hatred, and now she wanted revenge.
While the husband was more powerful, the wife was a master of formations. She painstakingly created a formation specifically for him.
The unique aspect of this formation was its deeply hidden nature, yet the key to it—the formation’s core—was placed in the most obvious location.
Once someone entered the formation, their attention would be drawn to the formation’s core. Just a glance would trigger the restriction spell, causing the body to gradually turn to stone from the legs up, eventually becoming a complete statue.
The wife used a beautiful woman as the core of the formation. The husband, seeing a beauty, would naturally lower his guard. The formation was so powerful that he unknowingly fell into the trap, unable to escape, turning into a stone statue, and the wife took her own life afterward.
Though the formation was passed down, it was rarely used due to its malicious nature. The name “Resentful Woman Formation” stuck, but later, finding it too crude, people renamed it “Stone Maiden Formation.”
Though the formation was passed down, it was rarely used due to its malicious nature, harming others excessively. Thus, the name has faded into obscurity, only remembered in tales as the “Resentful Woman Formation,” a name whispered with caution and folklore.
The icy chamber was filled with ice sculptures, with a breathtakingly beautiful woman lying at its center. Anyone who unknowingly wandered in would be on high alert, their senses heightened, observing every strange detail.
The ice platform and the woman in the center were the most peculiar and eye-catching. Even a casual glance would draw their attention, ensuring they couldn’t avoid her gaze.
Gu Fuyou and Zhong Michu saw it, which is why they were covered in frost. Ah Fu, not seeing it, escaped the trap.
Furthermore, all the ice statues were facing that woman. Clearly, after seeing her and falling into this trap, they were unable to flee in their panic and were frozen in place.
Gu Fuyou remarked, “The Stone Maiden Formation is very similar to the one in the ice chamber, differing only in their elements—one freezes, the other petrifies. Such formations focus all their power on the core, which is both the strongest and weakest point. It has the most potent attack and the weakest defense. Once the core is broken, the entire formation collapses.”
After finishing, Gu Fuyou glanced at Zhong Michu, who had her head slightly lowered, her long eyelashes casting shadows under the firelight.
Zhong Michu said, “But the core wasn’t the woman.”
Even though she was in a daze at that time and saw things hazily, she had heard the sound of jade breaking when Gu Fuyou broke the formation.
Gu Fuyou rested her elbows on her knees, her face in her hands, and said, “The core doesn’t necessarily have to be the woman. Anything that catches the intruder’s eye could serve as the core—like the gold phoenix crown or the green feathered robes on the woman. As long as it’s noticeable, it works.”
“How did you identify the core?”
Instead of answering directly, Gu Fuyou playfully dodged the question, asking, “Senior Sister Zhong, did you figure out the identity of that woman?”
The fire cracked, and a log at the bottom snapped with a loud bang.
Zhong Michu looked up and said, “The Azure Phoenix Clan.”
Chapter 14
One Day
Gu Fuyou said, “Yes, it’s the Azure Phoenix clan. The golden phoenix crown, the emerald feathered robes, and the bas-relief of a hundred birds paying homage to the phoenix are all elements exclusive to Azure Phoenix funerals. The hint of red at the corner of the woman’s eyes indicates she’s an Azure Phoenix from one of the three branches.”
The Azure Phoenix and Dragon clans are both ancient celestial beasts, said to have helped the Celestial Ancestor create the world, earning them a high status. They are the only two celestial beasts that can take human form.
The Azure Phoenix clan is divided into three branches: Qingluan, Daqing, and Shaoqing.
The Qingluan boasts emerald feathers all over, save for a distinctive red feather near its eyes. When transformed into humans, this red mark remains, resembling the rouge applied by women, adding a touch of charm.
Usually, members of the Azure Phoenix bury their dead within their tribe’s tomb, but the burial of this particular Azure Phoenix here lends an extra layer of mystery to the place.
Gu Fuyou continued, “When I brought you out, I saw an inscription above the ice door—’Ruizhu Palace.’ This confirms the woman’s identity as an Azure Phoenix.”
The Central Continent’s Danxue Mountain houses the famed Ruizhu Palace, while Penglai Island in the Four Seas is home to Penglai Palace. These palaces are the two most famous celestial palaces, respectively inhabited by the Azure Phoenix and Dragon Clans. Ordinary people wouldn’t dare to use these palace names lightly.
Watching the flickering firelight, Gu Fuyou said, “The Azure Phoenix clan is noble, always considered themselves superior. They highly value their bodies and wouldn’t demean themselves by using their own body as the formation’s core.”
“This formation is meant to keep outsiders away. When Xian Luo opens, the ones who usually enter are humans.”
“They look down on humans. Tens of thousands of years ago, humans were considered inferior to them, and even looking at them directly was seen as an offense. Although things have changed significantly now, arrogance is deeply rooted and hard to change. It makes sense that they would place the core under the woman’s body, as they subconsciously believe that those who enter are unworthy of gazing upon her face and should only bow their heads. So I guessed that the core was the ice platform beneath her.”
“In the end, it was thanks to Ah Fu that I found the weakness. It’s fitting that I named it ‘Ah Fu’. Ha-ha.”
Zhong Michu had been silently listening. She finally spoke up, “Even so, it’s an ancient formation. Knowing the core doesn’t make it easy to break.”
Gu Fuyou laid the sword embryo across her lap, caressing it thoughtfully. “I don’t know how it happened. The core’s defense was weak, but with my abilities, breaking it should have been extremely difficult. Yet, I broke it with just two strikes…”
Looking up at Zhong Michu with a radiant smile, Gu Fuyou said, “Maybe it’s thanks to the spiritual energy you transferred to me.”
“Don’t tease,” Zhong Michu said, knowing well that the spiritual energy she had transferred only stopped Gu Fuyou’s bleeding.
“I’m serious,” Gu Fuyou insisted.
Suddenly, Zhong Michu turned her head and coughed lightly.
Gu Fuyou’s playful expression vanished, replaced by worry, “Senior Sister Zhong…”
The earlier bleeding had indeed caused internal injuries. The ancient formation was powerful, and though the frost had melted, the damage wasn’t entirely gone.
Zhong Michu waved dismissively, “I’m fine.”
Gu Fuyou remained skeptical, “Really?”
Zhong Michu rested her forehead against the rock wall, slightly tilting her head back and closing her eyes. After a while, she opened her eyes and asked, “Is that weapon something you crafted?”
Zhong Michu rarely initiated conversation, and the few questions she had asked earlier were already unusual, probably due to the curiosity born from their brush with death.
Seeing her ask again now, Gu Fuyou realized she wanted to change the subject.
Sensing that Zhong Michu didn’t want to discuss her injuries further, Gu Fuyou sighed inwardly. Knowing wouldn’t change anything, and she couldn’t help anyway.
She bit her lip, touched her ear, and responded, “I’m crafting it without any clear plan.”
Gu Fuyou wasn’t in the mood to talk much, and after their brief exchange, they fell silent again. The fire crackled, and Ah Fu purred.
Feeling Gu Fuyou’s low spirits, Zhong Michu, for some reason, felt an inexplicable unease. Breaking her usual silence, she asked, “Why haven’t you crafted it completely?”
The sword embryo was only roughly shaped like a sword. If not complete, its power would be greatly limited.
Gu Fuyou replied, “It’s not the right time yet. This sword embryo…”
She stared at the sword embryo for a long time, then suddenly looked up at Zhong Michu with an enigmatic smile, “Can you guess why?”
Before Zhong Michu could respond, Gu Fuyou continued, tracing the patterns on the sword embryo, “I plan to make it into the most powerful magical weapon in the world.”
“I want to fuse ancient and modern formations into it, using them like talismans. With just a command, it could deploy a formation, but unlike talismans that are single-use, this could be used thousands upon thousands of times, endlessly. It would develop its own spirit, allowing it to cultivate like a human, absorbing spiritual energy, refining its body, and even evolving and improving the formations. That way, even someone like me, with no cultivation talent and low spiritual energy, could wield it and compete with Nascent Soul or even Hallow Void stage masters.”
“But because it’s so difficult to refine and I still lack many materials, it’s incomplete.”
She hadn’t shared these thoughts with anyone in a long time. When she was younger, people dismissed her as naive and childish for saying such things. As she grew older, others would mock her for being delusional and overambitious.
She had resolved to keep these dreams to herself, but she couldn’t resist when Zhong Michu asked twice.
Partly, it was the thrill of narrowly escaping death that spurred her to speak, and partly, she had a gut feeling that Zhong Michu wouldn’t look down on her.
As expected, Zhong Michu looked slightly surprised but showed no disdain. Her expressions were always subtle and sparse, which Gu Fuyou used to find dull, but now she cherished that calm demeanor.
If Zhong Michu had shown even a hint of scorn or treated her words as a joke, Gu Fuyou would have been deeply hurt and disappointed once more.
Fortunately, that didn’t happen.
Zhong Michu asked, “Do you want the core of a Hallow Void spirit beast for this purpose?”
“Yes.” Gu Fuyou responded, smiling and looking straight into Zhong Michu’s eyes, not wanting to miss any of her reactions.
Zhong Michu shook her head. “There are countless ancient and modern formations. Fusing them all would require a treasure of extraordinary power to withstand it. The spiritual energy needed to sustain such a weapon would be immense, requiring billions of spirit stones. Where would you find that? And letting it evolve and improve formations on its own is unheard of. No one would think or dare to attempt such a thing…”
Gu Fuyou retorted, “Tens of thousands of years ago, the idea of humans cultivating immortality was unheard of. No one thought it possible, but look at us now. Immortal sects flourish, and the path of immortality thrives. Just because something doesn’t exist now doesn’t mean it will never be possible!”
Zhong Michu was taken aback, silently contemplating without further argument.
Gu Fuyou felt her excitement grow, as if a barren part of her heart was being nourished, causing a once withered flower to bloom.
She had so much to say about her dreams, but no one had ever understood. She had kept these thoughts bottled up for so long, yearning to share them. With even the slightest encouragement, she could talk passionately and endlessly.
She stirred the fire, “All types of formations in the world are derived from Yin and Yang and the Five Elements, spreading like the branches and roots of trees.”
“In the end, the foundation of any formation relies on treasures of the five elements: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. I already have a metal spirit and now the core of the Wind Beast, which is of wood attribute. Both are top-quality items. They may not be unique in the world, but they’re good enough as a foundation for endless variations. I only lack treasures of water, fire, and earth. As for the vast spiritual power needed, you don’t necessarily need so many spiritual stones. Just one thing will do…”
She paused here, initially wanting to reveal what that thing was. But on second thought, since Zhong Michu might not know about it, saying it might not be convincing.
Unexpectedly, Zhong Michu’s thoughts flashed, and she naturally continued, “Are you talking about Qilin Marrow?”
Gu Fuyou stared at her in shock, “You… you know about the Qilin Marrow?”
Qilin Marrow doesn’t refer to a specific item but a category of spiritual substances. These rare objects are born from celestial phenomena, occurring once every ten thousand years or even hundreds of thousands of years.
Qilin Marrow could manifest as a spring of water, flowing magma in a volcano, or even the blood of a spirit beast. The spiritual energy contained within QilinMarrow is vast, comparable to the cosmos. When not in use, it seems like an ordinary item with no detectable special properties. But once activated, even a single drop can rival the combined spiritual energy of endless miles of spiritual mines.
If such an item appeared, it would be a divine treasure that would drive all cultivators to madness.
However, the long intervals between appearances mean that records of Qilin Marrow are scarce. Many people don’t know about it, and those who do often doubt its existence.
Suddenly, Gu Fuyou blurted out, “Senior Sister Zhong, Senior Sister Zhong, there are three thousand paths to immortality, no path is the only one!”
Zhong Michu was silent for a while, unable to ignore her expectant gaze, and sighed softly, “Follow your heart and let nature take its course…”
Joining in, Gu Fuyou smiled and said, “Even grass, trees, and stones can become immortals!”
Filled with emotion, her voice trembling, Gu Fuyou asked, “Senior Sister Zhong, have you also read the ‘Records by the Azure Emperor’?”
Zhong Michu had intended to explain that she was only looking up some things, but seeing Gu Fuyou so happy, her smile so bright, she found herself simply saying, “Yes.”
Gu Fuyou felt a deep joy, as if she had met a kindred spirit, lamenting they hadn’t known each other sooner.
‘There are three thousand paths to immortality, no path is the only one, follow your heart and let nature take its course, even grass, trees, and stones can become immortals.’ This quote from the ‘Records of the Azure Emperor’ resonated deeply with her.
This book, once banned, was written by one of the past leaders of the Azure Phoenix clan, a figure the world respectfully called the Qing Emperor. It’s been tens of thousands of years since, and his name is lost to history.
The book covers a wide range of topics, including astronomy, geography, formations, artifact refinement, rare treasures, and spirit beasts, filled with unusual and insightful knowledge.
The Qilin marrow is one of the treasures recorded in the ‘Records of the Azure Emperor.’
The book was banned due to its eccentric and unconventional content, describing many spirit beasts and treasures that no one had seen in modern times, leading people to dismiss it as fanciful and misleading.
Additionally, it contained a scathing critique of the Four Immortal Sects. At that time, the Four Immortal Sects were just a minor sect, so they kept silent. Now, having gained more influence by dominating a continent, they have banned this book.
Despite the ban, the Four Immortal Sects still secretly believed in some of its records—each year, they would perform astrological calculations to predict the birth of Qilin Marrow.
Upon learning that the Qilin Marrow would appear in this century, they’ve discreetly dispatched people worldwide to search for it.
By now, there are only a few copies of Records of the Azure Emperor left in the world. She had to put in a lot of effort to obtain one.
Zhong Michu not only possesses a copy but has also read it.
Gu Fuyou never would have imagined someone like Zhong Michu would read a banned book.
This gave Gu Fuyou a new perspective on Zhong Michu, seeing her in a more vibrant light.
Gu Fuyou offered the sword embryo to Zhong Michu, looking at her earnestly, “Senior Sister Zhong, would you like to take a look?”
Seeing the eager expression on her face, Zhong Michu couldn’t bring herself to refuse.
Accepting it, she felt the cool touch of the sword embryo. Its texture was soft, and it looked like dark jade. “Is this a Yin-Yang jade? It’s of excellent quality.”
Though called jade, Yin-Yang jade has the texture of jade but is tougher than any metal. It can absorb spiritual energy and balance the five elements.
High-quality Yin-Yang jade has an immense capacity, even able to absorb the spiritual energy of an entire spirit stone mine. This thing is quite impressive when used for making magical artifacts, but high-quality yin-yang jade is rare, very rare, and can be encountered but not sought after.
Gu Fuyou’s eyes sparkled even brighter with excitement. She leaned towards Zhong Michu and exclaimed, “Yes, it’s a Yin-Yang jade!”
She realized she had spoken too loudly, felt embarrassed, and quickly sat back down.
She felt like a child who had just found a friend, eagerly presenting her most cherished toy and being overjoyed at the slightest praise.
It took her quite a while to calm herself down, worried that her excessive excitement might make Zhong Michu uncomfortable.
Staring into the fire, a gentle expression crossed her face, “Senior Sister Zhong, the first time I encountered formations, I knew they would be my lifelong passion.”
“I’m not very talented, you know that. I might never reach the Golden Core stage in my lifetime.”
“So I want to create this magical weapon to prove that formations aren’t just a niche skill, to show that effort matters. Even without talent, without the ability to cultivate, I can still stand shoulder to shoulder with the greats.”
“I know forging this sword will be incredibly difficult, but even if it takes my whole life, one day, one day…”
As she spoke, memories flooded her mind, bringing a sting to her eyes. She quickly wiped away the moisture and looked at Zhong Michu with a smile, “Senior Sister Zhong, I’ve only ever shared these thoughts with you. Don’t laugh at me, and please don’t tell anyone.”
She had opened up too much today, sharing thoughts she usually kept to herself. She knew she might feel embarrassed later.
Perhaps due to her lingering injuries, Zhong Michu wasn’t sitting as upright as usual. Instead, she leaned lazily against a rock, watching Gu Fuyou silently.
The firelight reflected in her eyes, making her look warm and inviting.
She finally spoke, “Gu Fuyou, you are incredible.”
Truly incredible.
Gu Fuyou dared to dream big, her imagination unrestrained.
She had a goal she was passionate about, willing to dedicate her life to it. She burned like a fire, her dreams shining brightly when she spoke of them.
Zhong Michu had no clear idea of what she wanted to do with her life. It seemed to her that her entire life’s path was in clear view: cultivate and eventually ascend to immortality.
For her, whether she becomes an immortal or not didn’t matter. Cultivating was just a part of her life, just as eating is for mortals. She didn’t particularly love it, nor was she averse to it.
It felt too mundane. At times, even her memories seemed colorless.
Deep down, she was somewhat envious of Gu Fuyou, who had found a passion worth dedicating her life to. Even though she didn’t have such feelings herself, she could somehow understand them, which is why her words were sincere.
Blushing, Gu Fuyou said, “Senior Sister Zhong, don’t make fun of me. What’s so incredible about me? You are the incredible one.”
Zhong Michu retorted, “Am I?”
It wasn’t a teasing question; it was a genuine inquiry.
Gu Fuyou assumed she rarely left the mountain and wasn’t aware of how her skills compared to other cultivators. She thought Zhong Michu wouldn’t consider herself incredible without a comparison.
Filled with emotion, Gu Fuyou jumped to her feet, her voice filled with fervor, “You are incredible! Truly incredible!”
“You reached dual cultivation of the Golden Core Stage before the age of a hundred. Throughout history, there have been very few like you. Among women alone, you are certainly the first. You will certainly ascend and be revered throughout history. You’re the really incredible! Really, I swear!”
“Really?” Zhong Michu responded softly, a faint smile tugging at her lips.
For the first time, Gu Fuyou saw her smile.
Her face was as radiant as white jade, a delicate flower speaking warm words.
Blushing deeply, Gu Fuyou sat back down and covered her face with her hands.
Chapter 15
Meeting the Azure Phoenix Again
The two of them rested for half a day, only leaving the cave once the firewood had burned out.
Zhong Michu’s complexion had improved after half a day of meditation and recuperation.
Standing on the mountainside, they looked out over the landscape. As far as the eye could see, there was not a single trace of green.
Gu Fuyou thought to herself, Just randomly falling into a place like this almost got us killed. Who knows if we’ll make it out of this place alive.
Feeling disheartened, Gu Fuyou said, “If we knew where the center of the inner layer was and had enough spirit stones, maybe we could find a way out directly.”
Zhong Michu asked, “Do you have a plan?”
Gu Fuyou picked up a round, charred stone from the ground and explained, “Elder Liuhe once mentioned that Xian Luo’s entire shape is spherical. The top is the outer layer, the middle is the mid-layer, and the bottom is the inner layer. Spiritual energy flows downwards, accumulating at the bottom. That’s why the inner layer has a richer concentration of energy, nurturing fiercer spirit beasts, while the outer layer has weaker energy, and thus weaker beasts. At the very top of the outer layer, where the energy is weakest, the defensive barrier is at its thinnest. Every seven hundred years, on this day, the barrier becomes so thin it’s almost nonexistent, creating an opening: the main gate to Xian Luo.”
Rotating the stone, Gu Fuyou continued, “There’s a formation called ‘Zhuan Fengshui’ which can reverse the flow of spiritual energy. If we reverse Xian Luo’s energy flow, pushing it to the outer layer, the center of the inner layer would become the weakest point with the most fragile barrier, creating an exit.”
While the Zhuan Fengshui formation defies the natural order and consumes a massive amount of spiritual energy, lasting only a short time, for them, a mere blink would be enough to escape.
Gu Fuyou sighed heavily, lamenting, “Unfortunately, we don’t know where the center of the inner layer is.”
After pondering for a moment, Zhong Michu said, “Perhaps some spirit beasts might know.”
Gu Fuyou’s eyes lit up. Zhong Michu made a good point, given her knowledge of beast-taming, they could seek answers.
However, her excitement quickly faded. The spirit beasts of the inner layer were all at the Golden Core Stage or above. Sending Zhong Michu to ask would be like throwing her into a tiger’s den.
Reading her concern, Zhong Michu said, “We could look for gentler spirit beasts that are not fond of fighting.”
“But it’s still dangerous,” Gu Fuyou countered.
“We can’t just sit here and wait to die,” Zhong Michu asserted.
True to her words, staying put wasn’t a solution. No one knew they were here, so no rescue was coming.
They decided to head down the mountain to seek a spirit beast for directions.
As they reached the middle of the mountain, a strange wind blew from behind them, carrying a barely audible sigh.
They both turned around. There was no one behind them, but they saw the half Jacaranda tree on the mountain, half of it visibly withering into ash, dispersing with the wind as if it had never existed.
Zhong Michu remarked, “This tree is very strange.”
Gu Fuyou then shared with her about seeing this tree in the sky, and how she had chopped off half of its branches to use as firewood. She laughed, “This tree saved our lives.”
Zhong Michu pondered, “It’s the only living thing in ten miles. I wonder why.” She also noted the earlier sigh, which vanished in an instant, as truly unusual.
Gu Fuyou asked, “Senior Sister Zhong, do you know the meaning behind the Jacaranda Tree?”                                                                                                             Zhong Michu shook her head. Gu Fuyou said, “Legend has it that a woman, upon hearing that her lover had died far from home, was so overwhelmed with grief that she took her own life in despair and transformed into a Jacaranda tree. They say this tree symbolizes love lost in despair.”
Gu Fuyou chuckled, “Maybe it transformed from one of the elders of the Azure Phoenix clan who was buried in the Ice Chamber. Otherwise, why wouldn’t her body be buried with her clan, but here instead?”
Although Gu Fuyou made the comment lightheartedly, she seemed serious. Regardless, both had no way of verifying it, but deep down, both held suspicions about this place.
The two continued downhill. The deeper they went, the more their heartbeats intensified, causing an inexplicable sense of foreboding.
Reaching the foot of the mountain, they found a stone statue. The statue depicted a spirit beast sitting atop a stone tablet, its face determined, looking towards the peak. Chains passed through the base of the stone tablet, extending into the distance.
They had not noticed it earlier from above or on the mountainside; it was only upon closer inspection that they saw it. The statue was made of obsidian, blending in with the charred stones of the mountain, making it difficult to detect.
Gu Fuyou recognized it almost immediately. It was a formation known as the Ten Direction and Five Elements Evil-Suppression Formation, the most formidable of sealing formations.
There must be similar statues in the distance, ten in total, connected by chains, encircling the mountain peak.
This formation was typically used to seal off extremely malevolent beasts. But using an entire mountain peak for suppression, Gu Fuyou had never seen such an extravagant formation.
It was unclear what kind of beast it was suppressing.
Upon entering the cave at the mountain’s peak, it was entirely covered in ice. She had broken the formation within the Ruizhu Palace, and after retrieving the artifact, the ice on the cave walls didn’t show any signs of melting. Even where they made a fire, the ice showed no signs of melting.
The icy rocks formation inside the cave have nothing to do with the formation in the Ruizhu Palace. There must be another reason.
It was most likely another formation causing ice to form at the peak of the mountain, possibly in response to the Ten Direction and Five Elements Evil-Suppression Formation to hold down the beast below.
The beast must be of a fire attribute.
Of course, these were just Gu Fuyou’s speculations without evidence. But one thing was certain; such elaborate measures wouldn’t be used to contain anything good.
Gu Fuyou glanced back at the mountain peak, feeling as if she could hear the roar of an ancient beast. A cold shiver ran from the sole of her feet up her spine. She knew they shouldn’t linger, so she immediately said, “Senior Sister Zhong, let’s leave quickly.”
Zhong Michu also sensed something and agreed. They left, and after walking a distance, Zhong Michu realized she could fly with her sword. She carried Gu Fuyou and they flew off.
They eventually landed in a dense forest. Zhong Michu put her sword back in her sleeve when suddenly, a grumbling sound was heard.
She looked at Gu Fuyou to see her cheeks flushed, holding Ah Fu in front of her face, “It’s hungry…”
After a pause, Gu Fuyou mumbled, “I’m hungry too.”
She had been dizzy with hunger in the desert, and after resting a bit, had somewhat recovered. But after facing one challenging event after another, she was completely exhausted.
Zhong Michu said, “There should be wild fruits in the forest to help with our hunger. We can also look for spirit beasts.”
The two went deeper into the forest. The inner layers were rich in spiritual energy, nurturing everything around. The environment was thriving with various plant species.
Tall trees stood proud, ancient pines reached for the skies, bamboo stalks appeared pure, willows swayed gracefully, and thousands of flowers and leaves intertwined, dancing in the light and shadows.
Annoyingly, although the vegetation was abundant, fruit-bearing plants were hard to find. They went deeper into the dense forest, finally finding a plum tree. After picking some plums, they heard rustling noises coming from the nearby bushes.
They turned around and saw, just three steps away, grass parting not for a spirit beast, but a person stepping out.
“I was wondering who intruded into my territory. It turns out it’s just two little girls.” The woman who emerged held a staff in her hand. Despite her rough attire and hair tied with simple hairpins, she radiated an air of nobility.
She still had a charming presence, clearly having been a beautiful woman once.
Most notably, she wore no makeup, but the corners of her eyes were painted in a seductive red.
Gu Fuyou couldn’t help but say, “It’s another Azure Phoenix.”
Although Gu Fuyou spoke in a whisper, the woman heard her clearly. Her expression changed, and she asked in a stern tone, “Another Azure Phoenix? Have you encountered another one… Did you come from the mountain on the eastern side of the forest? Have you seen her?”
Gu Fuyou instinctively felt danger in her tone. The woman gave Gu Fuyou a glance, and when she saw Zhong Michu by her side, her expression momentarily stiffened. Her eyes circled around Zhong Michu, and with a furrowed brow, she muttered, “Huh, very strange…”
Gu Fuyou, unsure of her meaning, felt an instinctual wariness about this woman and quickly said, “We didn’t know this was your territory. We entered by mistake. Please forgive us, we will leave immediately and not disturb you.” With that, she tried to pull Zhong Michu away.
By the woman’s tone, it seemed she recognized the woman from Ruizhu Palace. If they were blamed for disturbing the peace of that woman, who knows what might happen.
The woman extended her staff, hooking Zhong Michu around her waist, “Where do you think you’re going?”
Gu Fuyou felt as if a heavy weight pressed on her feet, rendering her unable to move.
The woman laughed, “It’s been tens of thousands of years since anyone visited here, and now two little girls appear. One at the Golden Core stage, the other at Qi Practicing. Just children, daring to come to the inner layers with such meager cultivation. Are you here seeking death?”
Upon hearing this, Gu Fuyou was shocked. A thousand years? This woman must be at least at the Nascent Soul stage.
The woman retracted her staff and said, “Follow me.”
Zhong Michu and Gu Fuyou felt the pressure lift, but the thought of fleeing never crossed their minds. Their cultivation gap was too vast, so they obediently followed.
After walking for a while, the scenery suddenly opened up. The trees around them towered, their branches forming a natural dome, yet the area was still brightly lit with vibrant greenery. Ahead, four or five bamboo houses were enclosed by a fence.
The woman pointed at Zhong Michu, “You, come with me.”
Then to Gu Fuyou, she said, “You, don’t step into my yard. You’ll dirty my place.”
Gu Fuyou stared in disbelief. Why was Zhong Michu allowed inside while she was considered unclean? Was it just because Zhong Michu was more attractive?
Neither Gu Fuyou nor Zhong Michu moved.
The woman turned to see Zhong Michu hadn’t followed, “What, are you scared I’ll eat you? Your little bit of flesh wouldn’t even stick between my teeth.”
Zhong Michu said, “I don’t understand why the senior has specifically brought us here.”
The woman glanced at her, “It’d be a waste for someone so young to perish here. I thought I’d heal your injuries.”
“I am not injured and need no treatment,” Zhong Michu replied.
Gu Fuyou interjected, “No, you are injured.” She had been concerned about the injuries Zhong Michu sustained from the formation and blurted it out without thinking.
“Not injured?” The woman tapped Zhong Michu’s head with her staff, “I’m not blind. What is this, then?”
Zhong Michu suddenly widened her eyes, staring at the woman in shock.
The woman, tired of talking, hooked Zhong Michu’s waist with her staff and dragged her inside, with Zhong Michu unable to resist.
“Senior, senior! My junior sister is also injured, you…”
Without turning her head, the woman tossed something back over her shoulder. Gu Fuyou caught it and saw it was a bottle of pills.
The woman said, “As long as you don’t go beyond this courtyard, no spirit beasts will bother you. But if you wish to go out and seek death, I won’t stop you.”
These words were clearly meant for Gu Fuyou. Gu Fuyou slightly pursed her lips, clutching Ah Fu, not daring to get close to the fence.
Since there was no danger outside the courtyard, it was no harm to wait here. She found a dry patch of grass to sit on, took out some plums she had earlier, and ate them while waiting for Zhong Michu.
Although the Azure Phoenix clan doesn’t particularly like humans, they did not randomly take lives. Earlier, she inadvertently revealed that they had visited Ruizhu Palace. Thinking about it now, the woman’s reaction was not one of anger but surprise. Gu Fuyou had been overly cautious, mistakenly thinking the woman was out for revenge.
It was strange that the woman suddenly offered to help Zhong Michu, but it was not entirely unbelievable. If she wanted to hurt them, she could have done it straight up without any tricks.
After finishing the plums, and with Zhong Michu still not appearing, Gu Fuyou meditated to recover some spiritual energy, but Zhong Michu still didn’t come out.
Bored from waiting, Gu Fuyou stood up and wandered elsewhere, when suddenly her eyes caught something sparkling.
She screamed excitedly and ran towards it.
Just beneath the old trees in the forest, spiritual herbs were lush and thriving, with rare flowers fresh and tender. Clusters and bunches of spiritual flowers and herbs were growing vigorously.
This place was a treasure trove!
The value of a spirutual herb, subjectively, depends on whether you need it or not.
However, objectively, people classify the rarity of a herb into different grades: common, precious, rare, very rare, and immortal.
Gu Fuyou wasn’t as skilled as Si Miao in distinguishing spiritual plants, but she could roughly tell that the plants here were at least of the very rare grade!
Initially, Gu Fuyou was extremely excited, thinking about taking these back to Si Miao, who would probably go mad with joy.
She found a thick piece of wood and began digging up the spiritual flowers and herbs, soil and all, storing them in her storage bag. Eventually, when the bag could hold no more, and there were still more plants left, she even took off her outer robe to use it for carrying them.
After a while, as the initial excitement faded, Gu Fuyou threw down the piece of wood and said, “It’s no fun being happy alone.”
“It would be great if Senior Sister Zhong was here.”
Picking up Ah Fu, who was crawling around nearby, and said, “Let’s go find Sister Zhong, tell her the good news, and let her be happy too.”
“But that Azure Phoenix said we can’t go in…”
“We’ll sneak in.”
Chapter 16
Leaving Xian Luo
An idea popped into Gu Fuyou’s mind, and she immediately put it into action.
She neatly stored away her storage bag and wrapped the harvested spiritual herbs and rare flowers in her outer robe, making a bundle. She carried it on her back and picked up Ah Fu, heading straight to the front of the courtyard.
Standing in front of the fence, she called out, “Senior Sister Zhong, Senior Sister Zhong.”
It had been light all day, and Gu Fuyou guessed she must have been out for about twelve hours, essentially a whole day and night.
After calling out several times, a woman came out. Hearing Gu Fuyou, her eyebrows shot up in annoyance. “What’s all this noise?” she snapped.
She extended her staff over the fence, pushing Gu Fuyou away and said, “Stay away from my courtyard.”
Gu Fuyou: “…”
Gu Fuyou asked, “Where’s my Senior Sister?”
“She’s resting,” the woman replied curtly and then ignored Gu Fuyou, muttering to herself as she walked back to the porch, “Humans are so noisy.”
The woman went on to tend to the spiritual flowers and herbs in the yard. Seeing this, Gu Fuyou immediately turned and left, appearing to stroll casually but secretly sneaking around to the back of the courtyard.
The back fence of the courtyard was different. It was a row of earth walls covered with green vines and adorned with unknown flowers, looking particularly elegant.
When Gu Fuyou approached, she found that no matter how she walked, she couldn’t get close to the courtyard wall. She was always five steps away from it.
Looking around, she realized the back of the yard was protected by a maze-like formation.
The formation was exquisitely set up, and Gu Fuyou, thrilled at the challenge, concentrated intently. When she finally broke through the formation, she felt a surge of satisfaction and accomplishment.
Excitedly, she ran to the wall, used it to gain leverage, and flew up, landing steadily on top.
Peering inside, she found the view entirely different from what she had seen outside.
The backyard was incredibly spacious, like an emerald forest with oddly shaped trees and a light mist swirling about.
The person she was looking for was right there in the backyard.
She was sitting on the twisted roots of an ancient tree, leaning against its trunk, eyes closed as if asleep. A bird perched on her open palm, tilting its head to look at her. The sunlight filtering through the leaves draped her in a silky glow.
She seemed surreal, like a person in a painting.
Zhong Michu had let her hair down, her long black hair cascading over her shoulders like ink.
Gu Fuyou noticed something in Zhong Michu’s hair, but couldn’t see it clearly. Instinctively, she wanted to get closer, forgetting she was still on the wall. She leaned forward and, with an “ouch,” fell off the wall.
She rolled on the ground, cushioned by the bundle on her back, so she wasn’t hurt.
Before she could stand, a shadow loomed over, blocking the sunlight.
It was Zhong Michu, her hair now neatly tied up again, standing beside Gu Fuyou and looking down at her. “What are you doing?” she asked.
Gu Fuyou looked up at Zhong Michu, noticing nothing unusual in her hair and assuming she had been mistaken earlier. She sat up and asked, “Senior Sister Zhong, did that person do anything to you?”
She initially intended to summon Zhong Michu directly but feared it might hinder any healing process. Hence, she decided to check personally.
Zhong Michu shook her head. “The elder did not mistreat me.”
“She didn’t allow you to come in, and now you’ve sneaked in. She might blame you, so it’s better to leave first. I’ll bid farewell to the elder and leave with you.”
“Okay.” As Gu Fuyou stood up, relieved that Zhong Michu was safe, she held many words in her heart, planning to discuss them once they were outside.
Just as she was about to discreetly climb back over the wall, she suddenly heard a voice, You’ve got some nerve, girl, sneaking into my courtyard. Are you seeking death?”
A chill ran down Gu Fuyou’s spine, and she turned around to see the same woman from the front courtyard, coldly staring at her from a distance.
Feeling guilty, Gu Fuyou said, “Elder…”
The woman glanced towards the wall and smirked, “You’ve got some skills, little girl. Did you break that formation?”
Zhong Michu stepped in front of Gu Fuyou, shielding her, “Elder, please forgive us. My junior sister has been waiting outside for a long time, feeling uneasy and worried about my safety. That’s why she intruded here without proper manners.”
“You’re quite protective of her,” the woman remarked, her gaze shifting between the two before settling on Gu Fuyou for a moment. With a cold snort, she tossed over a crystal stone and said, “Both of you, get out of here. Don’t stand around and annoy me.”
Zhong Michu caught the crystal and replied, “Thank you, elder.”
Gu Fuyou, feeling as if she had been granted a great pardon, quickly added, “Thank you, elder, for your leniency.”
The woman had a strange temper, so the two of them, not wanting to linger and risk upsetting her further, quickly left through the back gate.
Zhong Michu turned back to bow respectfully to the woman once more, and Gu Fuyou followed suit, saying, “We apologize for the disturbance and are grateful for your care. We’ll take our leave now, and we’ll always remember your help…”
“Go on, go on!” the woman said impatiently, “Humans really are a nuisance.”
Gu Fuyou felt a bit awkward but kept silent.
Once they were a good distance away and out of sight, Gu Fuyou exhaled a huge sigh of relief, feeling much lighter. She stretched her body, the pressure from the woman now gone, and even her steps felt much lighter.
She showed Zhong Michu the bundle and grinned broadly, “Senior Sister, I found a lot of spiritual plants in an old forest. They’re all rare types, so at least the dangers we faced after falling into the inner layer weren’t for nothing. When we get out, once Si Miao refines the pills, I’ll share half with you.”
“Oh, and there’s more!” Gu Fuyou suddenly remembered, pulling out a handkerchief from her pocket. She unwrapped it to reveal a soft-glowing, snow-white pearl. Handing it to Zhong Michu, she said, “Senior Sister Zhong, this is a rare treasure used to stabilize the formation in Ruizhu Palace. It’s an ice-attribute treasure, perfect for your water spiritual root. If you absorb it, your cultivation will definitely improve.”
Zhong Michu replied, “You went through so much trouble to get this. You should keep it for yourself.”
Gu Fuyou insisted, pushing it into her hand along with the handkerchief. She smiled and said, “We’re in this together. It wouldn’t be fair if I kept all the benefits. I have the core of a Wind beast. You take this, one for each of us. It’s perfect.”
As Zhong Michu was about to refuse again, Gu Fuyou quickly ran a few steps away, holding Ah Fu, and called back with a laugh, “If you try to give it back, I won’t take it. If you don’t want it, just throw it on the ground.”
Only then did Zhong Michu accept, saying, “Thank you for your kindness.”
“Senior Sister Zhong, don’t be so formal with me,” Gu Fuyou said. They had been through life-and-death situations together, and Gu Fuyou had already considered Zhong Michu a close friend. She didn’t like the polite distance between them.
Gu Fuyou asked, “Senior Sister, how are your injuries?”
There was a moment of silence from Zhong Michu. When Gu Fuyou didn’t receive a reply, she looked back at her.
Zhong Michu softly said, “I should be… okay now…”
She handed the crystal stone to Gu Fuyou and changed the subject, “The elder knew we were looking for the center of the inner layer. She told us the mountain we’re heading to is the place. She probably knew our purpose and hence gave us this crystal stone.”
In the Immortal Realms, spirit stones are typically used as currency because they contain spiritual energy useful for cultivation, alchemy, and array formations.
Crystals were the result of compressing spirit stones to their limit. Typically, it takes tens of thousands of spirit stones to produce a single crystal, so the spiritual energy within is immense.
It can be used to supply the spiritual power required by the Zhuan Fengshui formation.
Gu Fuyou, holding the crystal, wondered, “Why would this elder help us so much without any apparent reason?”
The Azure Phoenix was naturally proud—an attribute common to their clan. This particular Azure Phoenix was especially strange, with a capricious temper. Despite seeming difficult to deal with, she unexpectedly took the trouble to heal Zhong Michu, didn’t hold a grudge for Gu Fuyou’s intrusion, and even gifted them a crystal stone to help them leave.
Perhaps the Azure Phoenix cannot be judged by appearances; despite her harsh words, she might actually have a kind and gentle heart.
Zhong Michu explained, “The elder said she had some old connection with my ancestors, which is why she helped. She didn’t elaborate further.”
Gu Fuyou chuckled, “So, it’s all thanks to Senior Sister Zhong’s good fortune.”
Gu Fuyou knew that Zhong Michu’s mother was Elder Yunran. Since both were prodigiously talented, she thought it wasn’t improbable for her powerful ancestors to have connections with the Azure Phoenix. Although she was curious, Gu Fuyou didn’t dwell on it.
They left the woman’s territory and headed straight for the peculiar mountain, following the road they came, encountering no spiritual beasts on the way. They reached safely, passed the stone statues of the beasts, and, despite the lingering anxiety, climbed to the peak.
Gu Fuyou started setting up the formation. Once the formation was ready, they simply needed to throw the spirit stone into the formation’s core, and the formation would activate.
Although the crystal stone contained a lot of spiritual energy, it would only sustain the Zhuan Fengshui formation for a short while.
Gu Fuyou and Zhong Michu were already standing inside the formation. As soon as the spirit stone was thrown, they would be able to bid farewell to this dangerous place.
Gu Fuyou took a moment to gaze into the distance. Inside Xian Luo, they couldn’t feel the change of seasons, but by her calculations, over three months should have passed in the outside world. Reflecting on the various events they had experienced on their journey, filled with ups and downs, she couldn’t help but feel emotional.
Zhong Michu called out to her, “Gu Fuyou?”
Snapping back to reality, Gu Fuyou asked, “Senior Sister Zhong, are you ready?”
Zhong Michu nodded in confirmation. Holding Ah Fu, Gu Fuyou tossed the crystal stone into the formation’s core. Initially, nothing happened, but within three breaths, the wind and clouds transformed, and a hole of light appeared beneath their feet, leading to a meadow covered in dimond-shaped flowers.
They fell through the void and landed safely on the ground. Looking back at the large gate to the inner layer, they saw it had already closed. After three breaths, it reappeared in the air in front of them.
Inside Xian Luo, the distance between the inner and outer layers was vast, but in the external world, it was merely a few steps.
“We’re out!” Gu Fuyou exclaimed joyfully, lifting Ah Fu up high, only to realize she was struggling with its weight.
Ah Fu had grown too quickly. Not long after birth, its body had become plump, its once grayish-white fur hardening and darkening, no longer resembling the fragile creature it once was.
Zhong Michu stood by, watching her silently.
Gu Fuyou’s joy was short-lived as she remembered that Gu Huaiyou and Si Miao were still trapped inside Dizang’s mouth, their safety unknown. Though she believed in their abilities to protect themselves, she worried they might be stuck without a way to escape. She decided to go back into Xian Luo to find the Dizang.
The entrance to Xian Luo spun for a moment before returning to its original position, allowing them to re-enter from the outermost layer.
Gu Fuyou thought that since she no longer had the spirit stone with her, there was no risk of mistakenly entering the inner layer again. With Zhong Michu by her side, she felt reassured.
But Zhong Michu had just been through life and death with her. They had finally gotten out, and she hesitated to ask her to go back in.
While she was contemplating, a group emerged from the entrance of Xian Luo. The man leading the group, riding a flying carriage, was none other than Zuo Tianlang.
The group seemed to have reaped a rich harvest, as the carriages behind them were filled with nets bulging with Dizang meat.
Gu Fuyou glanced at the nets and saw that they were filled with Dizang meat. Her expression changed, and she thought, “Zuo Tianlang captured Dizang. What about Gu Huaiyou and Si Miao…?”
She was about to step forward and intercept Zuo Tianlang to ask about the whereabouts of Gu Huaiyou and Si Miao.
But then she saw two more people emerge from the celestial gate of Xian Luo, following behind the Zuo family convoy.
It was a young man and woman. The man wore dark, form-fitting clothes and had numerous injuries on his face. The woman was dressed in a dark-colored dress, its original color indiscernible as she looked like she had been pulled from a pool of blood.
As soon as they landed, the man gently laid the woman down, lightly patting her cheeks and calling out in distress, “Sister! Sister!”
The woman remained unconscious. The man suddenly raised his head, eyes filled with fury, glaring at Zuo Tianlang, who was driving the carriage in the sky. He stood up and shouted at the Zuo family members in the sky, “The esteemed Xu Ling Zuo family, abusing your power and committing violence, showing no regard for human life. Do you have any sense of justice? Have you no shame?”
Chapter 17
Defying Heaven’s Wrath
This man’s cultivation is not weak, and his booming voice carries far and wide across the wilderness.
In the wilderness, besides the Zuo family and Gu Fuyou and others, there are other cultivators, some who have just finished their training, some waiting outside, and others who have just arrived to enter the Xian Luo for training.
The Xian Luo gate does not have a fixed schedule for opening. Sometimes it’s open for decades, and other times, only a few months.
This time, after the Four Immortals Sect’s divination, it was announced to the world that Xian Luo would be open for a year. Thus, people arrived at their own pace.
Many were drawn to a man’s outburst and turned their attention to him.
Zuo Tianlang, hearing the shouts, pulled on his reins and glanced downward, asking his subordinates, “Who dares to insult me?”
A person flew up on his sword and replied, “It’s the siblings from the Xiao family.”
Zuo Tianlang snorted coldly. ‘The Xiao family? They’re nothing more than minor city lords under Bailu City’s jurisdiction, not even qualified to be dogs to my Zuo family. That Xiao Yuan could serve as my shield, taking that hit, was her good fortune. Handle this matter. If Xiao Zhongting knows his place, I won’t hold it against him. But if he continues to insult the Zuo family, you know what to do.”
“Understood.”
The man flew to Xiao Zhongting, stood with his arms folded on his flying sword, without landing, and spoke from atop his sword, “Xiao Zhongting, your sister’s act of saving the young master will be rewarded. The Xu Ling Sect will send 100,000 spirit stones, a thousand spirit pearls, a hundred artifacts, and a hundred bottles of spirit pills as a token of gratitude.”
Xiao Zhongting, gravely injured and kneeling on the ground with bloodshot eyes, retorted, “Even if you offer countless treasures, what use are they? Can they restore my sister’s future? Can they heal her completely?”
“What do you want?”
“What do I want? Ha! Zuo Tianlang ruined my sister’s future, and you ask me what I want? I want him to apologize to her. Would he? I want the Xu Ling Sect to provide justice. Would they?”
The man, with a condescending look, responded, “Xiao Zhongting, the young master is willing to let this go, don’t be ungrateful. Your sister is nothing, and the entire Xiao family is nothing compared to the Zuo family. If you continue to make a scene, disturb public order, and slander the Zuo family, you won’t be able to bear the consequences.”
He then tossed a pill bottle, “This medicine can ease your sister’s injuries. Take them and think carefully about your actions.”
After issuing both a threat and a bribe, the man assumed Xiao Zhongting would know his place and prepared to leave.
Seething with anger, Xiao Zhongting grabbed the pill bottle and threw it at the man with all his might, roaring, “Who wants your Zuo family’s filthy pills!”
Although the man dodged, Xiao Zhongting’s action felt like a slap to his face, darkening his expression.
Xiao Zhongting continued, “Is there no justice in Nanzhou anymore, allowing you to be tyrants, treating people as less than human?”
The man took off a golden whip from his waist, and with a swift motion, lashed it across Xiao Zhongting’s chest, sending him flying back, blood spurting from his mouth.
With a cold smile, the man said, “In Nanzhou, the Zuo family is the sky, the Zuo family is justice! Who are you to challenge us? If you’re unwilling to accept our gracious offer, then the destruction of the Xiao family is just a matter of time!”
“You!”
The man lashed out again, striking Xiao Zhongting on the shoulder. Severely injured, Xiao Zhongting couldn’t dodge and could only struggle to defend himself.
The man continued to whip him, deliberately avoiding fatal blows but inflicting painful injuries.
Gu Fuyou, her face dark with anger, was about to intervene when someone grabbed her arm.
Turning around, her eyes lit up immediately. “Si Miao! Gu Huaiyou!”
It was Si Miao holding Gu Fuyou, with Gu Huaiyou standing beside her. Both of them seemed unharmed, and there was another man beside them.
This man had sharp eyebrows and bright eyes, standing tall with a long sword in hand—a handsome man one would not easily forget.
Gu Fuyou felt he looked familiar, as if she had seen him somewhere. But she couldn’t recall where. Judging by his attire, he must be a disciple of Xuan Miao sect. “This Senior Brother is…?”
Gu Huaiyou introduced, “This is the senior disciple of Elder Sanqing, Liu Guizhen. Brother Liu.”
Gu Fuyou greeted, “Senior Brother Liu.”
Liu Guizhen, with a stern face, simply nodded in acknowledgment.
The three had already noticed Zhong Michu and called out almost simultaneously, “Senior Sister Zhong.” They couldn’t help but appraise her simple attire.
Gu Huaiyou and Si Miao knew that Zhong Michu had come because Gu Fuyou had summoned her. Beyond their gratitude, there was a hint of sympathy in their eyes.
Zhong Michu remained calm and gave a slight nod to the three of them.
Seeing the situation unfold before her, Gu Fuyou felt the urge to intervene. Si Miao, understanding her intentions, cautioned, “Ah Man, it’s better if you don’t get involved in this.”
Gu Fuyou glanced at Xiao Zhongting, who, despite being whipped, grabbed the whip and fiercely pulled the man down from his sword.
The subordinates of Zuo Tianlang were not to be trifled with. Enraged, they went for the kill, intending to beat Xiao Zhongting to death.
Gu Fuyou frowned, “That man’s sister’s severe injuries are likely because of Zuo Tianlang. They show no remorse and now they want to beat that man to death. The Zuo family is a major sect in this region; how do they expect people to respect them with such behavior?”
“It’s not just ‘likely’,” Si Miao clarified. “That woman was injured by Zuo Tianlang himself.”
“What happened?”
Si Miao and Gu Huaiyou then recounted everything that happened after they got separated.
That day, the two of them were swallowed by Dizang, along with Liu Guizhen, who was protecting his junior disciples and couldn’t avoid being swallowed.
The three of them worked together and came up with a plan.
Si Miao burned the herbs she had on her, causing the Dizang to sneeze. The powerful force was too much for Si Miao and Gu Huaiyou to withstand, so Liu Guizhen created a barrier to protect them.
They were then safely expelled from Dizang’s body.
However, even after being expelled, their troubles weren’t over. Zuo Tianlang was determined to capture Dizang, creating chaos in the outer layer, affecting many cultivators who couldn’t escape.
While searching for Gu Fuyou, the three of them also got involved in the chaos.
Not long after, the Dizang became still, and everyone thought it was finally over.
Unexpectedly, as it exhausted its energy, its body started emitting a poisonous gas and its abdomen began to swell rapidly. Zuo Tianlang ordered his men to cut it into pieces for easy transport.
Just as they exerted force on its belly, the Dizang suddenly exploded.
The explosion was overwhelming, like mountains collapsing and the sky turning dark. The nearby cultivators couldn’t dodge in time, and Zuo Tianlang, who was closest, had no chance to escape.
Facing the explosion directly, he would have been seriously injured if not killed.
In the face of danger, Zuo Tianlang, keeping his composure, shouted, “Beard Slave, grab someone to shield me!”
The closest one was Xiao Yuan. Beard Slave, who was more skilled, took advantage of Xiao Yuan’s preoccupation with dodging the explosion and caught her off guard. With a swift move, he bound her and dragged her towards Zuo Tianlang. Zuo Tianlang then used both of them as a shield.
Both Xiao Yuan, at the early stage of the Golden Core, and Beard Slave, at the peak of the Golden Core, managed to withstand the blast.
Zuo Tianlang remained unharmed behind them. Beard Slave was left covered in blood, barely conscious, and Xiao Yuan, equally bloodied, passed out with her Golden Core shattered.
For cultivators, after forming the Golden Core, spiritual energy accumulates in the Dantian, much like the heart circulates blood. If the Golden Core is shattered, it’s almost impossible to repair, and without repair, their path of cultivation is essentially ruined.
The Xiao siblings were exceptionally talented, having grown up together without any conflict, and had both reached the Golden Core stage after over three hundred years of hard work.
In terms of talent, Xiao Yuan was even more gifted than Xiao Zhongting. Xiao Zhongting cherished and protected his sister, always giving her the best spiritual pills and medicines, hoping she would one day achieve great success in her cultivation.
This time, they came for training, only to suffer such a disaster.
Xiao Yuan’s path to cultivation was now essentially destroyed. How could Xiao Zhongting not be filled with hatred and resentment?
After hearing this, Gu Fuyou’s eyes were filled with disgust. “Zuo Tianlang’s actions are becoming increasingly shameless.”
Si Miao commented, “No matter how shameless, it’s still an internal matter of the Zuo family. Ah Man, we shouldn’t get involved. We don’t want to cause trouble for Uncle Gu.”
In Nanzhou, apart from Xiaoyao City and Xuan Miao Sect, other cities either fell completely under the Zuo family’s influence, willingly submitted, or succumbed to their power, essentially becoming vassals of Xu Ling Sect.
No matter how much the Xiao family protested, it was an internal affair of Xu Ling Sect, and outsiders, especially from Xiaoyao City, should not interfere.
The positions of Xiaoyao City and the Xuan Miao Sect in Nanzhou have always been delicate. Imagine the Xu Ling Sect ruling Nanzhou, they’d never be content with gaps in their own territory.
However, Xiaoyao City and Xuan Miao Sect had a good relationship, and their leaders were not easily swayed, making it difficult for Xu Ling Sect to act against them.
Nevertheless, if Xuan Miao Sect or Xiaoyao City made even a small mistake, Xu Ling Sect would not let it go.
That’s why Si Miao advised Gu Fuyou not to get involved.
When Zuo Tianlang’s subordinate used his whip, he infused it with spiritual power. With each strike, flesh tore and clothes were ripped apart.
Xiao Zhongting, covered in bloody marks, initially managed to fight back, but later, drained of spiritual power, he could only bear the beatings, although he continued to curse the attacker without ceasing.
If this Xiao Zhongting were an internal cultivator, his physical body wouldn’t be able to withstand such a beating. At this rate, he’d be beaten to death.
Although other cultivators were around, they didn’t dare intervene out of fear of Xu Ling Sect.
Just as Gu Fuyou couldn’t hold back any longer and was about to step in, a flash of sword light streaked past her, severing the golden whip in the man’s hand.
Zhong Michu said, “He’s going to die.”
The man didn’t want to escalate the situation but was angered by Xiao Zhongting’s insults. Now that someone intervened, he took the opportunity to back down.
Throwing aside the broken whip, the man spat at Xiao Zhongting, “Fool who doesn’t know the difference between life and death,” and left on his flying sword.
Xiao Zhongting struggled to his feet, bowed to Zhong Michu, and said, “Thank you, miss.”
With unsteady steps, he returned to Xiao Yuan’s side.
He didn’t want to bow to Xu Ling Sect by accepting their pills, but Xiao Yuan’s severe injuries were life-threatening without treatment. With his own spiritual power exhausted and injuries too severe to transfer energy to Xiao Yuan, he was in a difficult position.
Gu Fuyou set Ah Fu down and opened her bundle, saying to Si Miao, “They’ve left. It’s fine to help him now.”
Zhong Michu had already approached. With a surprised expression from Xiao Zhongting, she held Xiao Yuan’s hand, transferring her spiritual energy to her.
Gu Huaiyou took off his cloak and handed it to the barely clothed Xiao Zhongting, saying warmly, “Brother Xiao, if you don’t mind…”
Choked with emotion, Xiao Zhongting replied in a hoarse voice, “Thank you.”
Si Miao sighed and also came over, telling Zhong Michu, “Senior sister, her Golden Core is shattered. She can only absorb a fraction of the spiritual energy you’re giving her. It’s more effective to heal her wounds before transferring spiritual energy.”
Zhong Michu looked up at her but continued to transfer her energy.
Gu Huaiyou asked, “Do you have any methods?”
Si Miao hesitated, “I have a way, but I lack the necessary herbs. It’s quite troublesome.”
It’s tough to cook without ingredients.
Gu Fuyou had already opened her bundle, cheerfully handing it over, “I have them.”
Si Miao glanced at her and the herbs she held, taking a sharp breath, feeling almost dizzy, “Oh Heavens, Gu Huaiyou, I see your little sister holding a treasure trove of rare spiritual plants.”
Gu Huaiyou was equally shocked, “Really? Ah Man, where did you get these? Did you rob the Wanyao Pavilion?”
The Wanyao Pavilion is the biggest spiritual plant trading market in Nanzhou. Only there could one find so many rare spiritual plants at once.
Gu Fuyou replied, “I picked them in the forest.”
Si Miao grabbed her, saying through gritted teeth, “Tell the truth.”
Gu Fuyou laughed, “Why would I lie? Come on, save her first.”
Si Miao finally let her go and began selecting plants from the bundle, unable to part with each one she picked up. After a long while, she chose two suitable ones.
She transformed one into a fragrant essence and directed it into Xiao Yuan’s nose, while the other was turned into juice and fed through her mouth, guiding it to be absorbed.
Si Miao said, “Senior Sister, please transfer more spiritual energy to her. That should stabilize her injuries.”
Zhong Michu did as instructed, continuing the energy transfer.
Gradually, the girl’s complexion improved. When she opened her eyes, she called out, “Brother.”
Tears welled up in Xiao Zhongting’s eyes as he took her hand, “I’m here.”
Xiao Yuan seemed to understand what had happened to her, her expression filled with sorrow. She wiped her brother’s tears with the back of her hand. “Brother, men aren’t supposed to cry easily.”
Xiao Zhongting, choked with sobs, said, “It’s my fault. I couldn’t protect you.”
Xiao Yuan, her voice trembling, said, “It’s not your fault. I was just unlucky.”
Xiao Zhongting hugged her tightly, and the siblings cried together.
Seeing this, everyone felt a pang of sadness and prepared to say their goodbyes.
Si Miao picked another rare spiritual plant from Gu Fuyou’s bundle and handed it to Xiao Zhongting. “This is Wormheart Grass. It can be used to refine Spirit Restoration Pills. It won’t repair her Golden Core, but it will help…”
Xiao Zhongting, with both hands, gratefully accepted it and, along with Xiao Yuan, attempted to kneel in thanks.
Considering they were all peers, and Xiao Zhongting and Xiao Yuan were even older than Zhong Michu and Gu Fuyou, the group quickly moved to prevent the siblings from kneeling and helped them up.
With reddened eyes, Xiao Zhongting faced everyone and bowed deeply, expressing gratitude, “Thank you, Second Young Master Gu, thank you, Third Miss Gu, thank you, Miss, thank all of you.”
Then, he bid farewell and, supporting each other, the siblings slowly walked away.
Once the pride of the heavens, now fallen from grace.
Their departing figures were so sorrowful that no one could bear to watch. With a sigh, the group set off back to Xuan Miao Sect.
Chapter 18
Amidst Snow, Aromatic Sleeves Flutter by the Rail
Everyone returned to the Xuan Miao Sect and, after bidding each other farewell, went their separate ways.
Upon arriving in her room, Gu Fuyou carelessly dropped her bundle, bathed, changed her clothes, and without even giving a second thought to Ah Fu, she promptly went to bed, and fell asleep.
After resting for half a day, she went to see Ji Zhaoling the next day.
She came to apologize to Ji Zhaoling for summoning Zhong Michu into Xian Luo.
But she wasn’t afraid. Since her childhood, her spoiled and unruly behavior had often resulted in many punishments from Gu Wanpeng.
This not only emboldened her, but her skin had also thickened.
Ji Zhaoling met her in the sect leader’s study. Emerging from behind the rows of bookshelves, he wasn’t wearing the official sect leader attire but donned a simple, pale blue robe, holding a book, with a warm and friendly smile on his face.
It was the first time Gu Fuyou had seen him. If she had to describe her impression of him in one word, it would be “graceful.”
It’s hard to discern the true age of someone at the Hallow Void stage, but this man clearly possessed methods to retain his youthful appearance. With his handsome features and dark hair, he looked more like Zhong Michu’s elder brother than someone from her mother’s generation.
“Gu Fuyou,” Ji Zhaoling’s voice was rich and deep, slowly pronouncing her name as if adding a certain charm to it, “I’ve wanted to meet you, but I haven’t had the time, causing such a long delay.”
His deep, ink-like eyes seemed to be covered in a hazy mist. When Gu Fuyou met his gaze, she felt a sense of calm.
Gu Fuyou spoke of the Xian Luo incident. He listened attentively and at the end, smiled, informing her that Zhong Michu had already reported it to him upon returning to Xuan Miao Sect.
Ji Zhaoling did not punish either of them. Zhong Michu was not at fault for helping a fellow disciple, and Gu Fuyou did no wrong by summoning her spirit beast in a moment of crisis.
He not only refrained from reprimanding her but also comforted her, especially about her descent into the inner layers of Xian Luo.
As Gu Fuyou was about to leave, Ji Zhaoling called out to her, “Gu Fuyou.”
Gu Fuyou turned around at the door and asked, “Is there something else, Sect Leader?”
Ji Zhaoling spoke gently, “Get along well with Michu.”
After taking her leave from Ji Zhaoling, Gu Fuyou returned to her room.
Although she was spared from punishment, she felt a deep sense of loss.
Ji Zhaoling was an exceptionally gentle person; it was evident to anyone who met him.
From their brief conversation, Gu Fuyou felt the depth of his affection for Zhong Michu.
Zhong Michu’s mother was Elder Yunran, but who her father was remained unclear. While Gu Fuyou had no evidence, in her heart, she regarded Ji Zhaoling as Zhong Michu’s father.
Having such a caring and tender-hearted master and father, Gu Fuyou envied Zhong Michu deeply.
It’s worth mentioning that Gu Fuyou and others left Xian Luo early. When they came out, the opening time of Xian Luo hadn’t passed halfway, and most of the disciples who went to Xian Luo for training hadn’t come out yet.
There were no formal classes at Xuan Miao Sect, and disciples were left to their own.
Taking advantage of this free time, Si Miao was busy refining pills and planting spiritual plants, finding suitable spots for the spiritual flowers and herbs Gu Fuyou had brought.
This routine continued for over a month.
Si Miao had kept Gu Fuyou so busy assisting her that she didn’t find time to visit Gushen Peak, making it over a month since she last saw Zhong Michu.
Finally, after taking care of everything and crafting various pills, the two planned to sell them at Yinxue Pavilion, as was their custom.
They decided to use the occasion at Yinxue Pavilion for a celebration and also to extend an invitation to Liu Guizhen, thanking him for his assistance in Xian Luo.
Yinxue Pavilion is a bustling entertainment venue, renowned across the five continents for its constant lively atmosphere, performances, and beautiful women.
Yinxue Pavilion, a place teeming with women, had a high demand for beauty-enhancing and body-strengthening pills.
Si Miao and Gu Fuyou often brought their refined pills here to sell, earning some spirit stones and saving up some private funds.
Located in the conveniently accessible Wantong City, Yinxue Pavilion benefits greatly from the city’s extensive network of teleportation formations.
One-way teleportation formations can generally only go one way and are unstable, with a high chance of ending up in the wrong location.
The two-way teleportation formations require setups at both departure and destination points. If undamaged, allow stable travel back and forth.
Wantong City serves as a major transit hub, with many cities having two-way teleportation connections with it.
Many travelers, finding sword flight too slow and lacking teleportation formations between their points of interest, first teleport to Wantong City, then proceed to their desired location from there.
Wantong City is home to numerous teleportation formations, with nearly a thousand two-way formations, thereby living up to its name that suggests extensive connectivity
Consequently, Wantong City sees a large influx of visitors. It’s filled with taverns, tea houses, theaters, arenas, trading places for spiritual plants and beasts, dueling arenas, and countless other entertainment and trading venues. It’s bustling and unparalleled in its liveliness.
A teleportation formation at the foot of the Xuan Miao Sect connects directly to Wantong City, ensuring incredibly convenient travel.
Gu Fuyou and Si Miao went early in the morning and were pleased to find that the people at Yinxue Pavilion had reserved a good spot for them.
Their private room on the third floor was spacious and clean, overlooking the lively main hall. There was also an outdoor balcony, from where they could take in the bustling street view.
The woman leading them smiled and said, “The head of Yinxue Pavillion had received your message a while ago, and knowing you had left Xian Luo, assumed you would come here to celebrate. So, she kept this room vacant just for you.”
Here, the term used for the head of the establishment is ‘Zhai Zhang’ – a refined title.
In other pleasure districts, patrons usually refer to the matronly figures as ‘Mama’ and the younger, beautiful ones as ‘Sister’.
Yinxue Pavilion differs, primarily trading in arts and poetry, and only resorting to more sensual business as a last resort.
Hence, patrons here don’t frivolously engage with the women and, valuing sophistication, they respectfully refer to the manager as Zhai Zhang.
Si Miao went to deliver the spiritual pills. Meanwhile, Gu Fuyou leaned against the balcony railing, watching the play in the hall below. Soon, an irritated Si Miao joined her, her face flushed with a mix of annoyance and embarrassment.
“What happened?”
Si Miao replied, “Zhu Zhai Zhang halved the price for our spiritual pills. I couldn’t negotiate with her, so it’s up to you now.”
Simiao entered the room. Soon after, a woman leisurely ascended the stairs. With delicate steps and a graceful sway, she wore a pale blue shawl on her arm and held a fan in her hand. Her already beautiful face was further enhanced by her makeup, adding a touch of allure.
Upon seeing her, Gu Fuyou smiled and said, “Sister Zhu, you’ve almost made Si Miao cry.”
Zhu Ruo responded with a playful smirk, “She wouldn’t.”
Before they could converse further, Gu Huaiyou and Liu Guizhen arrived.
Upon entering, Liu Guizhen looked distinctly out of place and uneasy, his demeanor suggesting he wasn’t familiar with such establishments.
Gu Huaiyou had dragged him up by the arm. On the stairs, Liu Guizhen protested, “Brother Gu, the sect rules clearly state that disciples shouldn’t frequent such places. It’s inappropriate for us to be here.”
Gu Fuyou walked over and said, “Brother Liu, is there really such a rule in our sect regulations?”
She’s skimmed the sect rules and doesn’t remember seeing this one. Could she have missed it?
It shouldn’t be like that. There are many cultivation methods in the world. Some methods forbid indulgences like alcohol and romantic relations, but the cultivation method of Xuan Miao Sect doesn’t abstain from such things.
Liu Guizhen said, “It’s an unwritten rule.”
Gu Fuyou glanced down from the railing and laughed, “That doesn’t seem to be the case.”
Everyone followed her gaze and saw a few disciples sitting in a corner of the hall below. Liu Guizhen recognized them as fellow disciples, some even of the same generation as him.
Liu Guizhen was speechless.
Gu Huaiyou pushed him into the room, saying, “Brother Liu, we’re just having a meal together to thank you for your help. It’s not a raucous gathering. Yinxue Pavillion is famous for its food, you don’t want to miss it.”
As Gu Huaiyou ushered him inside, a beautiful woman in a blue dress followed them with a basket of vibrant flowers, the petals glistening with dew.
Gu Fuyou turned to Zhu Ruo and said, “Sister Zhu, everyone is here. Please have the dishes served.”
She then noticed the woman with the basket and smiled, “Sister, what lovely flowers you have.”
The woman in blue smiled back, “Is everyone here? The senior sister you praised so highly in your letter isn’t coming? I saw there were a few ladies here, so I picked some flowers for you to enjoy.”
Gu Fuyou picked a lily from the basket. Its pure white petals were plump, reminiscent of a dancing girl’s skirt.
She tucked it behind her ear, her long hair braided and hanging down her back. When she smiled, she was the picture of youthful charm. “Sister Zhu, how do I look?”
Zhu Ruo chuckled, “It looks beautiful, but probably not as beautiful as your Senior Sister.”
The woman in blue added, “You praised your senior sister so much in your letter that we’re all curious to meet such a graceful lady. It would be wonderful if she could become our sister too.”
Zhu Ruo’s expression changed and her voice deepened, “You’re speaking out of turn. She’s a celestial talent, pure and elegant. How could a place like ours be worthy of her?”
Realizing her mistake, the blue-clad woman quickly apologized, “You’re right, Sister Zhu. I misspoke.”
As they spoke, Zhu Ruo had already instructed the servants to bring up the food and wine. She also arranged for four elegant ladies to come and perform music.
The three entered the room, and Gu Fuyou walked out to the balcony, leaning on the railing.
Zhu Ruo looked at the street lights and sighed, “I just hope she doesn’t find our place too dirty for her.” Her eyes reflected a deep melancholy.
Gu Fuyou knew Zhu Ruo was reflecting on their status and reputation. In their line of work, they often faced disdain and sometimes even self-contempt.
Gu Fuyou reassured her, “Sister Zhu, she’s not like that!”
Si Miao, having overheard, teased, “Ah Man, when you first met Senior Sister Zhong, two out of three things you said about her were complaints. How is it that after one trip to the Xian Luo, you can’t stop praising her? Don’t you still find her rigid, aloof, and hard to get along with?”
Gu Fuyou smiled and rested her cheek on her hand, “After knowing Senior Sister Zhong for a while, I realized she’s like a river clam.”
Zhu Ruo was curious, “How so?”
Gu Fuyou grinned, “Hard on the outside, soft on the inside.”
Her words made all the ladies laugh.
Zhu Ruo, the woman in blue, and the four performers were all more curious about Zhong Michu, urging Gu Fuyou to invite her.
Unable to resist their persuasion and thinking it had been a while since she last saw Zhong Michu, Gu Fuyou decided it was a good idea. After all, she owed her thanks to Zhong Michu. Why not bring her over to join the fun?
Having made up her mind, she took out a talisman and called, “Nanzhu Jun.”
After the incident in Xian Luo where she was caught by a Wind Beast and couldn’t summon Zhong Michu due to a lack of spiritual power, she had the idea to refine the summoning formation into a talisman. This way, even if she was out of power, she could still summon Zhong Michu with the talisman.
As the talisman shone brightly, Gu Fuyou looked around, but saw no sign of Zhong Michu.
Zhu Ruo pointed downwards, “Is that her?”
Gu Fuyou looked down, her eyes lighting up. She stood at the railing and waved energetically below, “Senior Sister Zhong! Senior Sister Zhong! Over here!”
Zhong Michu, dressed in a snow-white robe with a light blue shawl draped over her shoulders, Zhong Michu looked up, her hair adorned with a jade bamboo hairpin.
Gu Fuyou turned to Zhu Ruo and the others, “Sisters, look!”
Several ladies moved to the railing to have a look. With beauties clustered together, they gazed at Zhong Michu below, commenting with smiles, “What elegance.”
“She really is a beauty.”
“A charming girl, so endearing.”
Gu Fuyou took the lily from her hair and tossed it down to Zhong Michu.
Seeing this, the other women laughed and each took a flower from the basket, throwing them down towards Zhong Michu.
The commotion drew the attention of those on the floors above and below. As they noticed the lively scene, they all moved to the railings to watch.
Upon seeing the beauty below, they joined in the fun, taking fresh flowers and tossing them down. Some even crushed the flowers, scattering the petals.
In no time, the air was filled with a rain of flowers, gently falling down.
Chapter 19
Nanzhu Drunk, Ah Man Branded
Zhong Michu had only been summoned by Gu Fuyou twice in times of crisis. She had always kept her promise, never using the contract for fun. So this time, when she was summoned, Zhong Michu assumed Gu Fuyou was in danger.
However, when she responded to the summons, she found herself on a bustling street, with tall red lanterns, fluttering colored ribbons, and a crowd of passersby. It was excessively lively.
Zhong Michu didn’t see Gu Fuyou anywhere and began to search for her when she heard someone calling her from above.
She looked up and, perhaps it was because of Gu Fuyou’s sweet smile, she spotted her instantly among the crowd leaning over the balcony.
Gu Fuyou was dressed in a vibrant red dress, her long hair braided and resting on her shoulders, with a lily tucked behind her ear. She was radiant, as dazzling as the morning sun.
Gu Fuyou then took the flower from her ear and tossed it down.
Zhong Michu, still confused, caught the flower, not understanding what it meant.
Soon after, a shower of flowers cascaded down from the towering red building.
The women above laughed and chatted, their merriment seeming to gather all the world’s joy to this spot.
Gu Fuyou was about to invite her up when Zhu Ruo commented, “Why did Miss Zhong leave?”
Gu Fuyou leaned over the railing and peered down, and sure enough, Zhong Michu was walking away. “She’s shy,” she noted.
Gu Fuyou called out to her twice with no response. In a moment of anxiety, she forgot their agreement and retrieved the summoning talisman, calling out,”Nanzhu Jun.”
This time, with better control, she summoned Zhong Michu directly to her side.
Zhong Michu, who had been walking forward, felt a sudden shift in her surroundings. She found herself on a balcony, naturally taking a couple more steps forward. Realizing something was off, she abruptly turned back to face Gu Fuyou.
Gu Fuyou greeted, “Senior Sister Zhong.”
Zhong Michu responded, “I thought you were in danger.”
Her tone seemed a bit off, probably annoyed.
Just as Gu Fuyou was about to explain, Zhong Michu approached her, handing back the lily, stating gravely, “Here, I’m returning this to you.”
Preoccupied with the idea that Zhong Michu was upset, Gu Fuyou reflexively accepted the flower, not immediately grasping its deeper significance.
However, Zhu Ruo and the others, being observant bystanders, noticed the exchange. Someone couldn’t help but chuckle, leading everyone to burst into laughter.
Hearing the laughter, Gu Fuyou suddenly realized the significance of what had happened. She looked at the flower in her hand, feeling as if it was burning her. Her whole body felt hot, her face flushed with embarrassment.
In ancient times, men and women expressed their affections subtly. Women would throw fruits from buildings at the men they admired, and men would throw flowers to women they were fond of.
Nowadays, this custom had evolved. Throwing a flower generally just expressed admiration.
Gu Fuyou throwing the flower was meant to show her admiration for Zhong Michu. The others joined in, either because they appreciated Zhong Michu’s appearance or just for fun.
Throwing a flower was no big deal, normally.
But Zhong Michu only caught the flower thrown by Gu Fuyou and gave it back. Gu Fuyou actually accepted it, which changed the entire implication of the gesture.
In ancient times, this act signified mutual affection, and that hasn’t changed.
Gu Fuyou said, “Sister Zhu, stop laughing. She doesn’t get out much and doesn’t know these customs!” Zhong Michu was a well-mannered girl who wouldn’t keep something that wasn’t hers. Even though she was angry, she politely returned the flower instead of throwing it back.
The other women laughed so hard they could barely contain themselves. Zhu Ruo, wiping away tears of laughter, said, “She might not know, but how could you not?”
Biting her lip, Gu Fuyou admitted, “I didn’t think of it at the moment!”
Zhong Michu might not have known the significance, but she understood it had something to do with the flower.
Seeing her expression, Zhu Ruo, still laughing, said, “Miss Zhong might not be aware of the meaning of catching and returning a flower. Let me tell you…”
Gu Fuyou yelled, “Ahhhh!!! Sister Zhu, please don’t tell her, I’m dying of embarrassment.”
But Zhu Ruo, not one to let go of a teasing opportunity, continued, “This flower, you see…”
Gu pleaded, “Sister Zhu, spare me. If you really tell her, I’ll jump off here and end my life.”
Zhu Ruo retorted, “You won’t die from jumping.”
Inside, the table was set with food and drinks. Gu Huaiyou came out and announced, “Alright, enough teasing. The feast is ready. Let’s invite our esteemed senior sister to join us.”
Gu Fuyou agreed and, turning around, took Zhong Michu by the sleeve, saying, “Senior Sister Zhong, don’t be angry. They were just joking. I invited you here to thank you for protecting me several times in Xian Luo. Brother Liu is here today as well; we should all gather and celebrate.”
Before Zhong Michu could respond, Liu Guizhen also came out. They exchanged greetings, and Liu Guizhen bowed, congratulating her, “Congratulations on your advancement, Senior Sister.”
“Thank you.”
Hearing this, Gu Fuyou’s face lit up with excitement. “Senior Sister Zhong, you’ve advanced in your cultivation?!”
Upon Zhong Michu’s arrival, Gu Fuyou sensed something was off, only to realize that Zhong had broken through to the mid-stage of the Golden Core.
She had guessed right; after a trip to Xian Luo, Zhong Michu had indeed made a breakthrough.
“It’s all thanks to the rare treasure you gave me,” Zhong Michu said.
She had absorbed it, and over the past month, she had digested half of its power, resulting in her breakthrough to the mid-Golden Core stage. Her spiritual energy was still slowly accumulating.
“In that case, we must celebrate even more. You can’t leave,” Gu Fuyou insisted.
With a playful tug on Zhong Michu’s sleeve, she led her inside and made her sit.
In the past, Gu Fuyou would have been more reserved around Zhong Michu, especially in life-threatening situations like those in the snowy forest. She wouldn’t openly test her limits. But now, seeing Zhong Michu differently, she forgot her usual restraint.
The ladies began to play the pipa, the music flowing like pearls falling onto a jade plate.
Zhu Ruo said, “I know cultivators are particular about impurities in their food. These ingredients are all spiritual plants, beneficial for cultivation.”
Sitting beside Zhong Michu, Gu Fuyou attentively served her dishes, saying, “Senior Sister Zhong, try some.”
“I’ve already renounced food,” Zhong Michu replied.
Gu Fuyou persisted, “I know, I know. But as a the sages say – there are certain tastes in life one must experience.”
Si Miao teased from the side, laughed. “I bet that ‘sage’ was you.”
Gu Fuyou, playfully tossing a fruit at her, picked up a slice of bamboo shoot, urging Zhong Michu, “Senior Sister Zhong, just try it. Yinxue Pavilion’s cooking is famous across the land. I promise you’ll love it and never forget the taste. I swear.”
After a moment of hesitation, Zhong Michu opened her mouth, her pristine teeth biting into the bamboo shoot, her tongue pulling it in.
It wasn’t Gu Fuyou’s sweet words that moved her, but something Gu Fuyou had said earlier: “There are certain tastes in life that one must experience.”
No one had ever spoken to her in such a way. Her teachers always preached, “Maintain your Dao heart, eliminate human desires. You are an immortal, not a human.”
Was discarding personal desires snd pursuing the Great Dao to become an immortal important, or was living joyfully and freely, cultivating as fate allowed, better?
In reality, the two notions aren’t conflicting. Her teachers, cherishing her talent and knowing her destiny was to become immortal, feared she might squander her potential if led astray by worldly pleasures. They chose to emphasize the former, keeping her focused solely on cultivation, avoiding the distractions of worldly splendor.
Because she rarely left Gushen Peak as a child and grew lazier to venture out as she grew up, she had gradually become like a caged canary.
She had long forgotten what she originally wanted for herself.
Yet, for some reason, after meeting Gu Fuyou, she slowly began to remember.
Gu Fuyou, holding her chopsticks, grinned from ear to ear, looking like she had accomplished something major, radiating a sense of achievement.
The group ate and drank, chatting happily. In truth, it was mostly Gu Fuyou, Si Miao, and Gu Huaiyou talking, with Liu Guizhen occasionally chiming in, while Zhong Michu spoke the least.
As the meal concluded, Gu Fuyou remembered that she hadn’t settled the price of the pills with Zhu Ruo. She quietly pulled Zhu Ruo aside into the hallway to discuss.
Gu Fuyou said, “Sister Zhu, the pills this time are different from before. They’re made from rare spiritual plants, so their quality and efficacy have greatly increased. You know, if we sold these elixirs at the Wanyao Pavilion, they would fetch a much higher price. We’re only asking for eighty percent of the market price because of our good relationship with you, but you’re still trying to cut the price by half. That’s really unfair to us. If Si Miao doesn’t cry, I certainly will. At least add thirty percent more.”
Zhu Ruo sighed, holding her round fan to her forehead, “It’s not that I don’t want to give you a fair price, but we’re really struggling financially.”
Gu Fuyou, sensing an underlying message, asked, “Is it the Xu Ling Sect again?”
The Xu Ling Sect controlled Nanzhou, requiring all major cities to tribute a large amount of spiritual stones annually. However, many officials pocket some for themselves. To maintain the amount they tribute while also lining their own pockets, they levy additional fees from the people under them.
Looking at the brightly lit and lively pavilion, Zhu Ruo sighed, “Wantong City has been increasing its spirit stone quota every year. My Yinxue Pavilion may look glamorous, but at this rate, who knows how long we can keep going.”
Frowning, Gu Fuyou let out a disdainful snort after listening, then started telling Zhu Ruo about the Xiao siblings outside Xianluo. The more she spoke, the angrier she got. “The world of cultivation today is not what it used to be. The days of emperors and rulers are long gone. Initially, no one was a slave to anyone else. It was through unscrupulous means that the Four Immortal Sects gained their dominance over the regions. That would have been tolerable, but while the other three sects respect the virtuous and have a relatively clear moral climate, the Xu Ling Sect treats everyone like slaves, with their oppressive and tyrannical rules. They really think they’re royalty.”
Gu Fuyou scoffed, “But as the saying goes, ‘cold eyes watch the crab’—let’s see how long they can continue their tyranny!”
Zhu Ruo quickly covered Gu Fuyou’s mouth with her fan, cautioning, “You mustn’t speak recklessly! Ah Man, remember, words are like hooked threads, pulling out troubles from the start. With the tense situation between Xiaoyao City and the Xu Ling Sect, if someone with ulterior motives hears your words and makes a big deal out of them, who knows what trouble it will bring? Everyone below them is filled with resentment, yet they dare not speak out against the Xu Ling Sect because they’re untouchable.”
Gu Fuyou pursed her lips, muttering, “In times like these, we can’t even speak our minds.”
Zhu Ruo chuckled, “You’re not just anyone; you have to be careful with your words.”
Seeing the topic was sensitive, Gu Fuyou moved on, “Sister Zhu, given these circumstances, just add ten percent to the price of the pills. I’ll also gift you a bottle of Rejuvenation Pills for vitality and longevity.”
Zhu Ruo only smiled in response. Gu Fuyou, not one to give up, continued with a playful tone, “Sister Zhu, come on, be nice to me. If you don’t raise it at all, Si Miao and I would have made this trip for nothing.”
Zhu Ruo said, “Alright, alright, you have a sweet mouth. I’ll add ten percent, and I’ll consider the banquet my treat.”
Delighted, Gu Fuyou said, “I’ll go get the Rejuvenation Pills for you.”
She went inside to get the spiritual pills from Si Miao. As she was about to leave, she felt something was amiss.
Glancing at Zhong Michu, she noticed her eyes were misty and her expression somewhat vacant.
Gu Fuyou took a couple of steps forward and, smelling the alcohol on her, exclaimed, “How did Senior Sister Zhong get drunk?”
She knew Zhong Michu never drank. Zhong Michu was very proper, and if she got drunk and lost her composure, she would be extremely upset when she sobered up. That’s why Gu Fuyou had only persuaded her to drink half a cup and not let her drink too much.
But in the short time Gu Fuyou was gone, Zhong Michu had gotten drunk.
The four women at the table giggled, “We just persuaded her to have two cups, and Miss Zhong couldn’t handle her liquor.”
“Oh no, this is bad,” Gu Fuyou worried. Not because Zhong Michu might blame her upon sobering up, but because if an elder discovered her state, they would hold Gu Fuyou accountable.
One of them laughed, “What’s so bad about it? Drinking and getting drunk is a common part of life.”
Another added, “Your senior sister is nothing like you described in your letter. She’s so obedient and gentle, not cold at all. She’s quite endearing.” To them, Zhong Michu seemed gentle because they were adept at dealing with all sorts of people at Yinxue Pavilion, mastering the art of persuasion like skilled foxes. Who could resist their coaxing?
Gu Fuyou replied with a smile, “It looks like you all are drunk too.”
With the feast ending and Zhong Michu drunk, everyone began to leave.
Gu Fuyou bid farewell to Zhu Ruo and, supporting Zhong Michu, mounted Si Miao’s three-legged crow. Along with Gu Huaiyou and Liu Guizhen, they headed back to Xuan Miao.
Upon reaching Gushen Peak, where flying on swords or spirit beasts was prohibited, Gu Fuyou had to help Zhong Michu down and walk up the mountain.
Zhong Michu, half-asleep, barely opened her eyes.
Liu Guizhen offered, “Let me carry Senior Sister up.”
“No, let me,” Gu intervened, “she doesn’t like being touched by others.”
Gu Fuyou carried Zhong Michu on her back and climbed the mountain. Zhong Michu was light, allowing Gu Fuyou to carry her with ease.
Si Miao and the other two followed closely. They were taking the front mountain path this time. The guard recognized Gu Fuyou and, seeing Zhong Michu behind her, didn’t stop them.
Gu Fuyou carried Zhong Michu into the courtyard. As they walked on the pebble path, a woman stepped out of the house. She wore her hair in a bun with a wooden hairpin, dressed in a purple robe, with a gentle demeanor and voice, “Michu?”
Gu Fuyou didn’t recognize the woman, but she knew that besides Zhong Michu, there was another person here who had previously been in seclusion, and so she hadn’t met her. Gu Fuyou surmised that this must be her.
Neither Gu Fuyou, Gu Huaiyou, nor Si Miao recognized her. However, Liu Guizhen’s eyes lit up a touch. Clearing his throat, he stepped forward, giving her a bow and greeted, “Senior Sister Dongli.”
Dongli responded, “Junior Brother Liu.”
She stepped forward, inquiring, “What happened to Michu?”
“Senior Sister Zhong is drunk,” came the reply.
Gu Fuyou intended to carry Zhong Michu into the house, but Zhong Michu semi-awakened in her drunken stupor and mumbled, “Gu Fuyou, you smell so nice.”
“What?” Gu Fuyou didn’t hear her clearly. Before she could ask again, her voice took a sharp turn, escalating into a scream, “Ahhhh!!!”
While carrying Zhong Michu, Gu Fuyou’s attire had become somewhat disheveled, revealing the skin between her shoulder and neck.
Zhong Michu opened her mouth and bit down on that exposed area.
The area was sensitive, and Zhong Michu bit hard. Gu Fuyou felt Zhong Michu’s sharp teeth pierce her skin. She collapsed to the ground in pain, and the others quickly came to help. Gu Fuyou, angry and hurt, exclaimed, “Senior Sister Zhong, are you a dog? Why are you biting me?”
Zhong Michu didn’t release her grip. Gu Fuyou felt a sharp, intense pain, as if Zhong Michu’s teeth had not only pierced her flesh but were gnawing on her very soul. The pain was unbearable, and she felt like crying out.
“Senior Sister Zhong, I apologize. Please, dear sister, let go. It hurts, hurts, hurts.”
Chapter 20
Fortune And Status Are Decreed By Fate, Not By Humans
After what felt like an eternity, Zhong Michu finally let go. The group helped her inside the house.
Gu Fuyou got up, walked over to the dressing table, picked up a mirror, and examined the spot where she had been bitten. There was a ring of teeth marks, with a faint red glow emanating from the deepest part, like the light from molten lava.
Finding it strange, Gu Fuyou pressed her shoulder and looked again. The red glow disappeared, leaving only a red and swollen mark where she had been bitten.
Zhong Michu hadn’t held back in the slightest. When Gu Fuyou pressed the area, it still hurt, though the sharp pain from before had subsided.
Annoyed, Gu Fuyou remarked, “Senior Sister Zhong, are you holding a grudge because I bit you back in Xian Luo?”
Dongli had already helped Zhong Michu lie down and told the group, “Thank you for bringing her back. It’s late, you should all head home now.”
Si Miao and Gu Huaiyou nodded and left. Liu Guizhen glanced at her, seemingly wanting to say something but remained silent and followed the others out.
Gu Fuyou was still holding the mirror. She placed it down and moved to the bedside, noticing that Gu Huaiyou and the others had already left.
Dongli smiled at her, “You must be Gu Fuyou.”
Gu Fuyou responded with a smile, “Senior Sister Dongli, you recognize me?”
Dongli replied, “Michu has mentioned you to me.”
Curious, Gu Fuyou inquired, “What did Senior Sister Zhong say about me?”
Dongli said, “She said you’re very good.”
“Really?” Gu Fuyou was skeptical, recalling how Zhong Michu had once accused her of being insincere in front of elder Liuhe. Yet she also felt flattered. Touching the end of her braid hanging in front of her, she shyly laughed, “I’m not that good.”
Gu Fuyou said, “Senior Sister Dongli, if you can’t manage Sister Zhong alone since she’s drunk, I can stay and help.”
As she spoke, she moved closer to the bed, noticing Zhong Michu’s face had a faint pink flush from the alcohol, but oddly, the skin near her temples was stark white, reflecting the light almost blindingly.
Thinking she was seeing things, Gu Fuyou rubbed her eyes to look more closely, just as Dongli covered Zhong Michu with a blanket, tucking her in snugly and only leaving her head exposed.
Dongli then stood up, obstructing Gu Fuyou’s view, and smiled, “Looking at her, she probably won’t cause too much trouble. I can manage alone. You should go back and rest early.”
Gu Fuyou, puzzled, mumbled in agreement, “Alright then. Take care, senior sister.”
After bidding Dongli farewell, Gu Fuyou stepped out. Before she left the courtyard, Liuhe hurriedly approached, “Dongli, the guards reported that Michu might be injured. What happened…?”
Gu Fuyou bumped head-on into Elder Liuhe, who gave her an up-and-down glance, “What are you doing here so late, smelling of alcohol?”
Gu Fuyou: “…”
Oh great, caught red-handed…
As it turns out, good and bad news like to arrive hand in hand.
The next day, Gu Fuyou and the others were summoned to the sect leader’s study for admonishment.
Coincidentally, Gu Wanpeng, having some free days, arrived from Xiaoyao City to visit the Xuan Miao Sect.
He had heard about the contract between Gu Fuyou and Zhong Michu but had been too busy to visit. Ji Zhaoling had assured him there was no need to worry, so he had delayed his visit until now.
On this visit, he wanted to clarify the matter of the contract, as the brief details in the letter weren’t clear enough. Secondly, he wanted to check on his children’s progress in the Xuan Miao Sect.
Gu Fuyou was putting on earrings in front of the mirror and talking to herself, “Why does father choose now of all times to visit? This is not a good thing at all…”
Although she voiced her complaints, she still dressed in a dignified smoky blue Luo dress and tidied up her appearance. She then asked Gu Huaiyou, “Gu Huaiyou, do I look good?”
Gu Huaiyou laughed, “You look great. Father will be pleased.”
Si Miao laughed, “It’s a coincidence that Uncle Gu came when you were making trouble. Are you dressing up to get a scolding?”
Gu Fuyou said, “You won’t escape punishment either!”
Turning back to Gu Huaiyou, she asked, “Is Eldest Brother really not coming?”
Gu Huaiyou replied, “If both Eldest Brother and Father came, who would oversee the city? If you want to see him, we’ll be allowed to return home and visit our family in a month. You can see him then, so there’s no rush.”
The three of them got ready and headed to the sect leader’s study, running into Liu Guizhen on the way.
Expressing regret, Gu Huaiyou said, “Brother Liu, we’ve dragged you into this.”
Liu Guizhen shook his head, “It’s not your fault.”
While conversing, they encountered Yuan Changsui.
Yuan Zhangsui had just come out of the study, having been reprimanded for accidentally injuring Gu Fuyou in Xian Luo.
Yuan Zhangsui’s face was sullen, but when he saw Gu Fuyou, he paused and then sneered, “Well, look at you, Third Gu, walking out unharmed.”
“Thanks to your good fortune,” she responded sarcastically.
Yuan Zhangsui waved his hand, “No, I wouldn’t dare take credit for Senior Sister’s achievement.”
Gu Fuyou questioned, “How do you know I didn’t just walk out on my own?”
Pointing to the study, Yuan Changsui said, “The sect leader intends for senior sister to inherit his position. The last initiation ceremony was her first involvement in sect affairs, and unexpectedly, it got disrupted by you. Then you had her break sect rules by entering Xian Luo, and now you’ve summoned her to a place of ill repute like the Yinxue Pavilion. What bad luck has our senior sister run into to have crossed paths with you?”
For once, Gu Fuyou didn’t retort. Si Miao spat out, “What does it have to do with you?”
“True, true. it’s none of my business.” Yuan Changsui, now in high spirits, walked away briskly.
Gu Fuyou’s expression was dark. Liu Guizhen suddenly said, “Don’t take his words to heart. Those things are nothing to Senior Sister.”
Liu Guizhen, standing with his arms crossed, made this statement with surprising conviction.
Looking at him, Gu Fuyou asked, “Really?”
Liu Guizhen replied, “There is one troublesome matter, though.”
Gu Huaiyou interjected, “Brother Liu, can you just say everything at once without pausing?”
Liu Guizhen explained, “The Grand Elder is in the study. He is strict and competitive, and I fear he may cause trouble.”
The three of them had heard a bit about the Grand Elder.
The Grand Elder, Ji Xiyan, was the sect leader’s younger brother. He liked to compete with his elder brother in everything, from cultivation to reputation, and even compared their disciples.
He was known to be strict with his disciples, and now that Zhong Michu was involved in this incident, he certainly wouldn’t let it slide easily.
When the four of them reached the study, they asked a disciple to announce their arrival and waited outside for a moment until they heard Ji Zhaoling’s voice, “Come in.”
Entering the study, they saw Ji Zhaoling seated at the desk. To his right was the Second Elder, an energetic old man with white hair and a beard, dressed in a black robe, holding a tea cup. Next to him sat the Sixth Elder, Liuhe.
The Grand Elder, Ji Xiyan, was leaning on the desk with one hand behind his back, resembling the sect leader but with a stern, harsh expression.
To the left sat a middle-aged man in a splendid purple and gold robe, with sharp eyebrows and a commanding presence.
The four of them bowed to everyone present. Gu Fuyou looked at Gu Wanpeng and greeted with a smile, “Father.”
Gu Wanpeng glanced at her and grunted coldly, causing Gu Fuyou’s smile to fade.
Ji Zhaoling said, “It’s good you’re here. Some elders mentioned you and Michu went to Yinxue Pavilion last night. Is this true?”
Gu Fuyou and her companions knew they couldn’t deny the truth, so they confessed.
Ji Xiyan tapped his fingers on the desk and said, “Sect Leader, Zhong Michu, as your senior disciple, should set an example. She violated sect rules by entering the Xian Luo and now went to such a disreputable place. Two offenses combined—how can kneeling in the ancestral hall suffice as punishment?”
Ji Zhaoling took a sip of his tea, then said calmly, “Xiyan, the matter with Xian Luo has already been resolved. You know the reason for Michu’s entry, and now even City Lord Gu has personally come to express his gratitude. If we still punish her, it would be disrespectful to City Lord Gu. Let’s consider her merits and faults as balanced. As for Yinxue Pavilion…”
Ji Xiyan exchanged glances with the second elder. The latter put down his cup and said, “Sect leader, we can overlook the Xian Luo matter, but these disciples’ visit to such places of ill repute is absolutely unforgivable!”
This Second elder had a rather gloomy temperament and was especially strict with disciples. His temperament was similar to Ji Xiyan’s, making them an impenetrable duo within the Xuan Miao Sect
Gu Fuyou muttered, “There’s no rule in the sect prohibiting disciples from going to such places, so why punish us?”
Everyone in the room, being cultivators with heightened senses, heard her clear as day.
Ji Zhaoling chuckled, “She has a point. Elders, what do you think?”
The second elder said to Gu Fuyou, “The reason there’s no written rule is that it’s an unwritten one. All the disciples know this and abide by it. Only you, indulging in frivolity and acting irresponsibly, went to that kind of place and even took your senior sister and brother there. Tell me, shouldn’t you be punished?”
Gu Fuyou raised her voice, “All the disciples know? Not necessarily! When we went there, we even ran into many senior brothers. If the elder doesn’t believe me, you can ask Senior Brother Liu.”
Ji Zhaoling asked, “Guizhen?”
Liu Guizhen nodded, “Sister Gu is not lying. There were indeed… other senior disciples there.”
The Second Elder’s face turned dark. Ji Xiyan said coldly, “Then punish all the disciples who went there. Even if there is no rule, you should all know in your hearts that cultivators should have a clear mind and few desires. You should be diligently cultivating, not recklessly having fun and indulging in pleasures?”
Gu Fuyou defended herself, “We didn’t indulge recklessly. After our experiences outside, we wanted to thank Senior Sister Zhong and Brother Liu, so we invited them for a meal.”
The second elder slammed the table, shouting, “Absurd! Ridiculous! You were in the wrong the moment you stepped into that place!”
“Why is it wrong?”
The second elder retorted, “Ignorant child, that place is filthy, teeming with lowly and sordid individuals. Associating with them could corrupt you, even with the slightest impure tendencies. Wouldn’t that be willing self-degradation, betraying the teachings of your masters and elders?”
Gu Fuyou felt a surge of anger. Her face flushed, her blood boiling, “They make an honest living, never doing anything against their conscience. They are no different from you, with two hands, two feet, and a head, standing tall and upright. How are they lowly? Are they less human than you?”
The second elder’s face turned a shade of purple, rage evident in his eyes. His spiritual energy circulated throughout his body, causing his robes to flutter without any wind.
Gu Wanpeng intervened, “Ah Man, mind your manners when speaking to your elders!”
Realizing Gu Wanpeng’s presence, the second elder suppressed his initial urge to reprimand Gu Fuyou. With no outlet for his mounting anger, he shattered the tea table with a slap, exclaiming, “Ignorant girl, how dare you compare an old man to women of pleasure!”
Ji Xiyan remarked, “Those women serve with their bodies, are fickle, and promiscuous. They willingly degrade themselves into the mud, they can’t blame others for despising them.”
Gu Wanpeng signaled Gu Fuyou to refrain from further comments. However, she retorted, “Isn’t it the ways of the world that force them? Isn’t it the Xu Ling Sect forcing them? Not everyone is born without worries for food and clothing. The slaves nurtured by the Xu Ling Sect, do they have a choice?”
“You were just lucky to be born into privilege. If the heavens were fair, giving them status, giving them spiritual roots, who knows, today they might be the ones sitting here, and not you, casting your disdain and hurling insults!”
“I am enraged!”
“Ah Man, enough!”
Chapter 21
Kneeling in the ancestral hall, the twin beauties discuss propriety
The Second Elder’s face was flushed with anger, and Gu Fuyou was filled with righteous indignation. The two glared at each other, and the atmosphere was tense as if swords were drawn.
Ji Zhaoling set down his tea cup, saying, “Enough.” His voice was like a spring breeze, carrying a gentle rain that extinguished the flames of anger.
The Second Elder let out a heavy sigh and said in a deep voice, “Sect leader, this girl has spoken recklessly and disrespected her elders. How can we let her off lightly?”
Ji Zhaoling smiled and said, “Elder, you also mentioned that she is just an ignorant girl, so it’s only natural that she might behave inappropriately. Why take her words seriously? As elders, it’s our duty to guide and show some leniency.”
Ji Zhaoling then turned to Liu Guizhen and the others standing by his desk, continuing, “Regarding the matter at Yinxue Pavilion, our sect has no specific rule against it. To punish you solely based on this would not be convincing to others. However, cultivators should focus on their cultivation and avoid places of debauchery and noise. I will sentence you to copy the Pure Thoughts Scripture once, to focus your minds and reflect on your actions. Do you accept this?”
Gu Huaiyou, Liu Guizhen, and Si Miao bowed and responded, “We, the disciples, accept the punishment.”
Ji Zhaoling’s gaze then settled on Gu Fuyou. After examining her expression, he slowly stated, “Gu Fuyou, your words and actions were inappropriate and disrespectful to your elders. In addition to copying the scripture, you will also be punished by kneeling in the ancestral hall for twenty four hours. Do you accept this?”
Gu Fuyou remained silent until Si Miao nudged her arm. She muttered, “I accept the punishment.”
The punishment was so mild it was hardly a punishment at all. Ji Xiyan was somewhat dissatisfied: “Sect leader, this punishment seems too…”
Ji Zhaoling interrupted, “Once the leader has spoken, there can be no changes.”
“But…”
Ji Zhaoling gestured with his hand to indicate that no further discussion was needed. “Enough, this matter is settled. Everyone may leave; I have other matters to attend to.”
Everyone had no choice but to take their leave.
Ji Xiyan and Second Elder walked side by side. Ji Xiyan sighed, “The sect leader’s kindness sometimes goes too far. With such gentleness, how can he establish authority? If this continues, how can he command respect in the sect?”
The Second Elder cast a cold glance at the departing Gu Wanpeng, sweeping his long sleeves behind him. He sneered, “Kindness? I see it as weakness,” and strode off.
Ji Xiyan said goodbye to Gu Wanpeng and hurriedly followed.
The Second Elder had a hidden meaning in his words, implying that Ji Zhaoling was lenient with Gu Fuyou and the others because he was wary of Gu Wanpeng.
Gu Wanpeng understood this. He felt guilty for causing trouble for Ji Zhaoling and quietly reprimanded Gu Fuyou, “You really need to know your limits.”
Gu Fuyou, being stubborn and defiant, especially when angry, would not back down if confronted. “Was I wrong in what I said?”
Gu Wanpeng said, “It’s not about whether you were right or wrong. Is that how you speak to your elders?”
Gu Fuyou defiantly responded, “He was the one who spoke disrespectfully first. Why should I respect him?”
“Because he’s your master, your elder, you must show the proper respect, even if he was wrong, it’s not your place to insult him. Otherwise, you’re in the wrong even if you were right. You may feel satisfied from scolding, but in the end, someone else has to clean up your mess!”
Father and daughter were both hot-tempered. Although Gu Wanpeng had matured over the years, losing the youthful recklessness he once had, and now exuded the demeanor of a city lord, he still struggled with managing his temper when it came to educating his daughter. Fortunately, his two sons were well-behaved, but his daughter…
“You seem to have forgotten all the manners you were taught at home,” the father chastised, pointing at his son. “You, as her older brother, should keep her in check!”
Gu Huaiyou spoke kindly, “Father, don’t be angry. Ah Man usually isn’t like this.”
The more Gu Wanpeng spoke, the angrier he got. “I know what she’s like! As soon as she entered the sect, she stirred up trouble and used tricks to summon the senior sister to form a contract, causing her to break the sect rules and enter Xian Luo, dragging the pure-hearted disciples into Yinxue Pavilion. It’s not enough for you to cause trouble yourself; you want others to be like you!”
“I thought after coming to Xuan Miao Sect, you’d learn some discipline. Tell me, what have you learned? You haven’t improved at all. You might as well have stayed at home.”
Gu Fuyou was already angry and resentful, and Gu Wanpeng’s last words hit her where it hurt, causing her to explode. She shouted with all her might, “I never wanted to come here in the first place! It was you who forced me. And now you’re saying I should have stayed home?”
Tears began to fill her eyes after her outburst.
Her brother tried to comfort her, saying, “Ah Man, don’t talk to father like that.”
But she pushed his arm away, overwhelmed by her feelings of injustice. Tears streamed down her face. “It was the Second Elder who started it by insulting Sister Zhu,” she exclaimed. “What did I do wrong? Why am I the one who’s wrong when I didn’t say anything incorrect? I will continue to speak like this! Always!”
“I did modify the formation to summon Sister Zhong because they all wanted to mock me and make fun of me! I summoned Sister Zhong myself with my own skills, so why shouldn’t I form a contract?”
“I entered Xian Luo, fell into the inner layer, barely escaping with my life, and you don’t even ask about it. All you do is criticize. No matter what I do, it’s always wrong in your eyes, just because it doesn’t align with what you want.”
Gu Fuyou sobbed, wiping the tears from the corners of her eyes with the back of her hand, her eyes red from rubbing. The tears wouldn’t stop. Pointing at Gu Huaiyou, she spoke between sobs, “You want him to manage me? He’s my brother, not my father. I’m your daughter, not his! If you don’t care, who else will?”
“Ah Man…”
By the end, she lost control and couldn’t stop herself. “You never care about me!” she cried, her voice breaking.
Gu Fuyou turned and walked away, only to see Zhong Michu coming from another path, clearly heading to the ancestral hall to be punished as well.
Gu Fuyou’s eyes were swollen and red, and her nose was red from crying. She didn’t want to talk to anyone and continued straight to the ancestral hall, removing the earrings from her ears as she walked. She tossed them fiercely into the grass beside the path.
Zhong Michu approached and greeted everyone, then continued towards the ancestral hall. As she passed the spot where Gu Fuyou had walked, her eyes drifted to the grass, and she silently picked up the earrings, wrapping them in a handkerchief.
Gu Fuyou walked straight to the stone gate of the ancestral hall, where a woman appeared before her, dressed in cloud-patterned robes, her hair like dark clouds, her eyebrows like spring mountains, and her eyes brighter than stars. She approached with graceful steps.
Although Gu Fuyou had never met her, she recognized her as Yunran, the esteemed cultivator. She stepped aside and bowed, “Disciple greets you, Elder Yunran.”
Yunran’s expression was indifferent as she walked past without a word.
Coincidentally, Zhong Michu arrived just then and came face to face with Yunran.
Zhong Michu paused briefly, then stepped aside and bowed, quietly addressing her, “Elder Yunran.”
Yunran seemed not to notice and walked away without acknowledgment.
Gu Fuyou and Zhong Michu entered the ancestral hall, where disciples were already waiting with disciplinary plaques. As soon as they arrived, the disciples guided them to kneel before the golden statues of their ancestors, handed them the plaques, and then left.
In the ancestral hall, the candles burned steadily, the incense smoke lingered in the air, and it was eerily silent.
Meeting Yunran had interrupted Gu Fuyou’s feelings of grievance and sadness, diminishing them by half. Unwilling to cry in front of others, and with Gu Wanpeng no longer around, she decided not to dwell on the upsetting matters.
Gu Fuyou first removed her own disciplinary plaque, changed from kneeling to sitting, and then removed Zhong Michu’s plaque as well.
Zhong Michu remained kneeling upright but noticed Gu Fuyou wiping the tears from her face. She reached into her sleeve, took out the handkerchief, and said, “Here, this is yours.”
Gu Fuyou took it, opened it, and saw it was her earring. The emotions she had managed to suppress surged back, and she bit her lip, holding back the tears in her eyes.
Zhong Michu said, “Wipe your tears.”
Without refusing, Gu Fuyou unfolded the handkerchief and covered her entire face, avoiding Zhong Michu’s gaze.
After a long while, Gu Fuyou asked in a hoarse voice, “Senior Sister Zhong, do you also feel that Yinxue Pavilion is a bad place?”
“If you think it’s a bad place, I apologize for summoning you there last night. I swear, I won’t let you step foot there again,” Gu Fuyou said.
Zhong Michu replied, “It’s not your fault. If I wanted to leave, you wouldn’t have been able to stop me.”
Gu Fuyou took the handkerchief away from her face and looked at her. She noticed that Zhong Michu was staring at her shoulder. As soon as their eyes met, Zhong Michu quickly looked away, smoothing out the folds of her robe.
“I…” After a pause, Zhong Michu finally continued, “I’m not sure what kind of place Yinxue Pavilion is. I’ve only heard sect members use words like ‘brothel’ and ‘pleasure house.’ When I asked my teacher, they always changed their attitude, saying it was a den of wickedness and not to go near it or even mention it. I seldom leave the mountain, so I don’t really understand.”
Hearing this, Gu Fuyou looked somewhat disappointed, thinking that Zhong Michu also viewed Yinxue Pavilion as an ‘den of wickedness’.
But then she heard Zhong Michu say, “Why don’t you tell me what kind of place Yinxue Pavilion really is?”
Gu Fuyou’s eyes brightened instantly. She hurriedly said, “What your master said isn’t entirely correct. While some places might be considered dens of wickedness, Yinxue Pavilion is different…”
She dragged a cushion close, only stopping when she was a step away from the cushion Zhong Michu was kneeling on, and sat down.
“Let me tell you…”
It turns out that in the previous generation, Yinxue Pavilion was just an ordinary pleasure house. The head matron was a kind-hearted person, but after a tragic incident where a young girl was abused to death, she thought about dissolving Yinxue Pavilion.
But there were problems. First, the girls would have nowhere to go and no means of making a living after Yinxue Pavilion disbanded. Second, even if they disbanded, other girls would still be sold and suffer; it would just be a change of location, and there was the risk that the girls, once released, might be captured and sold again, wasting her good intentions.
In the end, she let those who wanted to leave go and kept those who wished to stay, teaching them poetry and music so they could sell their talents instead of their bodies. The matron used her savings to buy as many trafficked girls as possible.
Zhu Ruo was one of those she bought. After the matron passed away, Zhu Ruo took over Yinxue Pavilion. Because of its unique style, the business flourished, and with enough spirit stones, she could even buy slaves from Bailu City.
But even with the claim of selling their talents and not their bodies, some people didn’t care and demanded favors. The powerful and influential ones were impossible to refuse, so Zhu Ruo had no choice but to accommodate them.
Therefore, most in Yinxue Pavilion were unfortunate and not in control of their own lives.
After listening, Zhong Michu remarked, “From what you’ve shared, both Zhu Ruo and the matron were admirable people.”
Gu Fuyou was thrilled to hear this, finally feeling at ease. She stretched out and lay down on the ground, a weight lifted from her heart. “Exactly!”
After chatting with Zhong Michu for a while, Gu Fuyou’s mood lightened considerably. She laughed, saying, “Sister Zhong, if you ever have questions about terms or words, come to me. I’ll explain them to you. Those masters of yours only take advantage of the fact that you don’t leave the mountain to feed you nonsense.”
“Alright.”
Gu Fuyou, recalling her previous encounter with Yunran in front of the ancestral hall, curiously asked, “Zhong Michu, isn’t Elder Yunran your mother? Why did you address her formally earlier?”
Zhong Michu’s hands tensed up suddenly. After a pause, she responded, “I don’t know.”
“You don’t know?” Gu Fuyou asked in disbelief.
“I really don’t know…” Zhong Michu’s voice was even more strained this time.
Suddenly, a realization struck Gu Fuyou. It wasn’t that Zhong Michu didn’t know why she had to call her own mother by name; she didn’t know why her mother forbade her from calling her ‘mother’!
She suddenly understood everything, and other doubts flooded her mind. She had already imagined various possibilities, but no matter which one, Gu Fuyou felt that Zhong Michu was in a situation similar to her own.
Gu Fuyou, feeling a mutual understanding with Zhong Michu, looked up at the ceiling of the ancestral hall and pondered, “Senior Sister Zhong, why are parents like this?”
Having overheard part of the earlier conversation between Gu Wanpeng and Gu Fuyou, Zhong Michu knew Gu Fuyou’s words carried resentment towards her father. She responded, “There are no inherently bad parents in this world.”
Gu Fuyou sat up suddenly, “How can there be no bad parents? If he brings me into this world, he should raise me. Since he’s raising me, he should love me. If he can’t do that, then there is something wrong!”
Zhong Michu frowned, clearly not agreeing with Gu Fuyou’s skewed logic. “Parents endure so much for us, and yet you speak as if they owe us something? It’s we who owe them for giving us life.”
“They chose to have me, did I have a choice? No, I didn’t.” Gu Fuyou said dejectedly, “If I had a choice, I… I’d rather she hadn’t given birth to me.”
Gu Fuyou hung her head, after a long time, she murmured, “What’s wrong with wanting his affection? He’s my father, the closest person to me in this world. If even he doesn’t love me, who in this world will?”
Her words were biased, but they struck a chord in Zhong Michu, shaking her to the core, especially the last sentence. She covered her heart, her face pale as if pricked by a needle, feeling extremely uncomfortable. She desperately wanted to rid herself of this strange feeling, so she retorted, calling Gu Fuyou, “Foolish!”
Disappointed by the response she hoped for, Gu Fuyou pouted and retorted, “Stubborn!”
“You… are unreasonable…”
“You’re the one who’s unreasonable!”
Frustrated, Gu Fuyou dragged her cushion back to its original place, still feeling it wasn’t far enough from Zhong Michu. She walked a couple more steps before putting down the cushion, lay down with her back to Zhong Michu, and stopped talking to her.
Chapter 22
The Spoiled Girl Doesn’t Understand Worldly Emotions
After she had been punished to kneel in the ancestral hall, Gu Fuyou returned to her room, sulking and avoiding her father, Gu Wanpeng.
Although Gu Wanpeng stayed at the Xuan Miao Sect for three days, the father and daughter ultimately didn’t meet again to have a proper conversation.
When it was time for Gu Wanpeng to return to Xiaoyao City, Gu Fuyou lay on her bed with her hair a mess, refusing to see him off.
Gu Huaiyou sat beside her and nudged her, saying, “Ah Man, there shouldn’t be lingering resentments between a father and daughter. Listen to your second brother, go apologize to father, and everything will be in the past.”
Gu Fuyou turned to face the wall, murmuring, “I did nothing wrong.”
Gu Huaiyou sighed. Outside, Gu Fuyou had a more restrained temper, keeping to herself unless provoked. But at home, she was fiery and stubborn, as if she was destined to clash with Gu Wanpeng. Whenever Gu Wanpeng was home, it was inevitable they’d have a minor argument every three days and a major one every five.
After a fight, their relationship would become strained, with neither willing to apologize.
Fortunately, while Gu Fuyou was stubborn, she was also willing to listen. After some persuasion from her eldest brother, she would usually reconcile with Gu Wanpeng, and his anger would dissipate.
However, her second brother’s words didn’t have much of an impact.
The two brothers often lamented that temporary persuasion was just a band-aid solution for their little sister’s rebellious nature. They worried she’d suffer in the outside world and didn’t know how she’d ever change her bad habits.
When Gu Fuyou was young, their family was made up of three men trying to raise a “rose,” which was already difficult. Gu Wanpeng was often busy with official duties and couldn’t always be home, while Gu Shuangqing was increasingly focused on his cultivation, starting to take over matters in Xiaoyao City. Gu Huaiyou was just a young boy at the time and didn’t know how to guide her.
Gu Fuyou was left to the servants, growing up freely and, eventually, in the wrong direction.
When the family realized this, it was already too late. Trying to correct her now would not only be an excruciating process for her but would also leave their hands bloody from the rose’s thorns.
Unless Gu Fuyou was willing to change herself, it was clear she didn’t want to. She thought she was just fine the way she was.
Perhaps one day, Gu Fuyou would meet someone she’d be willing to change for, someone she’d want to become better for.
Because of this, Gu Wanpeng and Gu Shuangqing had once considered finding a suitable husband for Gu Fuyou…
Gu Huaiyou advised, “Even if you don’t apologize, father is leaving. You should at least see him off.”
Gu Fuyou responded firmly, “I’m not going!”
“Huaiyou!” Gu Wanpeng’s voice called from outside the courtyard, urging him to hurry.
Gu Huaiyou stood up and said, “If you don’t resolve this now, it will be awkward the next time you see Father. Don’t tell me you plan not to return for the family visit next month?”
Gu Fuyou pulled the blanket over her head, saying, “I won’t go home if I don’t want to.”
Gu Wanpeng called out again, and seeing he couldn’t persuade her, Gu Huaiyou gave up and went to see their father off.
Once Gu Huaiyou left, the room fell silent.
Throwing off the blanket and with her hair in a mess, Gu Fuyou felt restless. She couldn’t fall asleep, couldn’t focus on a book, and ended up pacing back and forth.
Suddenly, she grabbed a wooden hairpin from the bedside, twisted her hair into a bun, and walked out.
She took a shortcut down the mountain and, upon seeing the teleportation formation, walked into the nearby woods and stood behind an old locust tree.
Soon, voices approached from the mountain path. Three figures slowly descended and stopped near the teleportation formation.
It was Ji Zhaoling, Gu Wanpeng, and Gu Huaiyou.
Gu Wanpeng had official matters to discuss with Ji Zhaoling and family matters to explain to Gu Huaiyou. Since flying down the mountain on their swords would be too quick to say much, the three walked slowly down.
Gu Fuyou managed to get there ahead of them. She saw them approaching but didn’t step out from her hiding spot, just leaned against the tree and watched as Gu Wanpeng said his goodbyes to the others and stepped into the teleportation formation until his figure disappeared.
While she was lost in thought, someone suddenly tapped her on the back. Turning around, she found herself facing Si Miao’s smiling face.
“You silly girl,” Si Miao teased, “If you want to see someone off, you should do it openly. Why hide and skulk around here?”
Gu Fuyou crossed her arms and gave a cold snort. “Who cares about seeing him off?”
Going out there to say goodbye would feel like admitting defeat, like she was backing down and admitting fault. Her feelings of injustice and anger would seem like nothing more than a childish tantrum.
But who takes their sadness lightly?
Without another word, Gu Fuyou turned and headed straight back to their room, as if she had just been out for a leisurely stroll. Si Miao’s face remained smiling, not pressing the topic further.
When they entered the courtyard, they immediately noticed a dark figure lurking on the porch, with a faint scent of blood lingering in the air.
Gu Fuyou called out, “Ah Fu!”
The dark figure turned around, revealing sharp fangs and fierce wolf-like eyes. With a piece of bloody raw meat still hanging from its mouth, it looked like a wild beast caught in the act.
However, upon seeing Gu Fuyou, the beast’s eyes softened, its pupils relaxing, and its fierce look faded away. It devoured the meat in a few quick bites and bounded over to her like an oversized puppy.
Gu Fuyou gave it a light smack. “You stink of blood! Don’t rub against me.”
As she walked into the house, Ah Fu followed, whimpering pitifully.
Once inside, she saw a large bloodstain on the floor, roughly the size of a full-grown bull, indicating that Ah Fu had feasted well before they returned.
She quickly opened a small pearwood cabinet inside, only to find it completely empty.
This cabinet was a storage unit similar to a storage bag , with a space inside the size of a room, where Gu Fuyou kept Ah Fu’s food supply.
Gu Fuyou stepped outside, glared at Ah Fu, and said, “Are you a pig? How can you eat so much?”
Ever since she had brought Ah Fu out, it had grown sharp fangs and become significantly bigger in just a day. Apart from occasionally asking Gu Huaiyou to hunt spirit beasts for Ah Fu’s food, she basically let Ah Fu roam free.
Ah Fu’s size and appetite grew daily. It would eat anything — the remnants of Si Miao’s pill concoctions, the meals Gu Fuyou cooked, and the flesh of the spirit beasts Gu Huaiyou caught. Now, it had even started sneaking into the storage cabinet to consume the stored food when she wasn’t around.
Gu Fuyou couldn’t help but marvel at this rare spirit beast. It had been only a few months since it was born, and it was already as intelligent as a human child.
“Isn’t Ah Fu growing too fast? Most Zhenmaos don’t grow like this,” Si Miao remarked.
Gu Fuyou also found it strange that Ah Fu was growing so quickly.
From birth until now, barely four months had passed, yet Ah Fu was already the size of an adult horse.
Its fur, which was originally grey with a tinge of white, was now shiny black. The fur on its belly and legs was white, completely like ‘dark clouds covering snow.’
Gu Fuyou pondered for a while, but couldn’t find an answer. She thought about asking Zhong Michu, perhaps she would know.
However, it’s fine when she didn’t think of Zhong Michu, but as soon as she thought of her, she started to feel uncomfortable again, irritable all over.
Since their argument in the ancestral hall, Gu Fuyou had been on edge. The dispute might not have seemed significant to others, but for someone like Zhong Michu, who seldom spoke and preferred to avoid conflicts rather than confront them, it was quite intense.
What bothered Gu Fuyou was that she didn’t want this tension between her and Zhong Michu, but she didn’t know how to make amends.
In the past, when she argued with Gu Wanpeng, Gu Shuangqing would always encourage her to apologize and point out where she went wrong.
Now, having argued with Zhong Michu, she didn’t know where she went wrong. In fact, she felt she hadn’t done anything wrong, yet they indeed had an argument.
It was frustrating.
The more she spent time with Zhong Michu, the less she knew how to get along with her.
When dealing with her family, Gu Fuyou always acted spoiled and silly to get attention, and eventually being willful and carefree became the norm. With Si Miao, they often teased each other, helping each other out along the way. When she was with Zhu Ruo and the others, they were like gentle and caring sisters who knew how to pamper and tolerate her, so she could be herself around them. As for Yuan Changshui and the others, who looked down on her, she became withdrawn, preferring to avoid them.
But how should she behave with Zhong Michu? She was worried that being too close might make Zhong Michu tire of her, while keeping a distance wasn’t something she wanted either. She didn’t want Zhong Michu to notice her strange temperament, yet hoped she would accept it.
Sometimes, she would act without thinking, and later regret her behavior, wishing she could go back in time and strangle her old self.
She wanted Zhong Michu as a friend so much. She believed Zhong Michu could be her confidant, someone with whom she could become close friends, sharing a deep, unbreakable bond. She wanted it more than anything, with a passion she had felt only once before, when she first discovered formations.
Gu Fuyou sighed, frustrated.
Dealing with her father, thinking about how to apologize to him, never required so much thought.
Thinking, thinking, Gu Fuyou chose to give up thinking.
And she maintained this mindset until the day Xuan Miao Sect allowed disciples to go home.
Due to a family matter, Si Miao had to return early. Gu Fuyou, still upset and not ready to go home herself, saw that Gu Huaiyou was deeply worried about Si Miao, prompting him to escort Si Miao back first.
After a few days, just as she was planning to go back, Zhu Ruo suddenly sent a message.
The Wandering Market is open.
This Wandering Market is the largest in the world, hosted by the biggest merchant guild. It opens every three years, attracting traders from everywhere. It’s a place where anyone, from the esteemed members of the Four Immortal Sects to ordinary villagers, can come to trade if they have something valuable to sell. Therefore, the merchants, buyers, and travelers that come are diverse: sect members, rogue cultivators, reclusive experts, you name it.
The market offered a range of items for trade, including magical artifacts, spiritual pills, spirit beasts, spiritual plants, rare treasures, and all sorts of wonders. Gu Fuyou’s ‘Records by the Azure Emperor’ was acquired from this very place.
There are also activities like beast battles, competitions, and scholarly debates were organized, offering generous rewards.
This is a grand event in the cultivation world, bustling with activity. Since the market is set up in different locations each time, it earned the name Wandering Market.
This year, the Wandering Market is set to open in Wantong City. Gu Fuyou had visited the Wandering Market several times before, always accompanied by her eldest brother, Gu Shuangqing.
However, this time, Gu Shuangqing was tied up with numerous obligations and couldn’t make it.
Gu Fuyou thought to herself that since she had been there a few times and was familiar with the rules, and since it was in Wantong City, so close by, she might as well go and take a look by herself.
With her mind made up, she packed her things that very day and descended the mountain with Ah Fu.
On her way down, she came across a wisteria tree and remembered that it was here where she had first seen Zhong Michu.
She walked over to the tree. Now, in midsummer, the wisteria was in full bloom, with clusters of flowers like light purple silk tassels.
Gu Fuyou counted on her fingers and realized it had been over a month since she last saw Senior Sister Zhong and hoped she was no longer mad at her.
With that thought in mind, she suddenly smelled a familiar, fresh scent, and looking up, saw Zhong Michu standing under the wisteria flowers, her ethereal beauty and the delicate flowers forming a charming picture.
Gu Fuyou glanced at the talisman in her hand, feeling embarrassed. She had only thought about it in her mind, but her hand had subconsciously taken out the talisman, and she had unconsciously called out her name.
Summoning her had become almost an instinctive habit.
Chapter 23
Adventures in the Wandering Market
“Senior Sister Zhong, I didn’t mean to…” Gu Fuyou clutched the talisman, feeling that his explanation sounded rather weak. Perhaps it would have been better not to explain at all.
Zhong Michu gently brushed aside the hanging wisteria blossoms with the back of her hand and stepped out.
Ah Fu trotted over to her, and Zhong Michu stroked its chin. It lowered its head, nuzzling against her.
Zhong Michu asked, “Are you going home?”
Her voice was calm and neutral, neither annoyed nor pleased, just as it always was.
A warm breeze blew along the mountain path, rustling the leaves. The air was filled with the sweet scent of flowers, and all seemed quiet.
Gu Fuyou watched as the sunlight fell upon her, and her heart suddenly calmed. Her eyes curved into crescent moons as she replied, “Yes.”
Oddly enough, she knew Zhong Michu was no longer angry.
“I need to go to Wantong City first. The Wandering Market is opening there this year. Then I’ll head home.”
Zhong Michu repeated, “The Wandering Market…”
Her tone was ambiguous as she said those words. Gu Fuyou asked, “Have you been there before, Senior Sister Zhong?”
Zhong Michu sometimes took a while to answer questions. Gu Fuyou often couldn’t tell if she didn’t want to speak or if she was considering how to respond. This time was no different. After a long pause, Zhong Michu said, “No, I’ve only heard of it.”
She then patted Ah Fu’s head and wished, “Safe travels.”
It wasn’t clear who she was addressing, but Gu Fuyou assumed she was speaking to her.
A sudden idea struck Gu Fuyou, and she said, “Senior Sister Zhong, why don’t you come with me?”
The thought had barely formed in her mind before the words left her mouth.
Zhong Michu looked somewhat surprised but declined.
Gu Fuyou wasn’t surprised. Although rejection was expected, her resolve only grew stronger.
She felt that Zhong Michu actually wanted to go. This feeling was baseless, but she couldn’t shake it. She thought to herself that if she was wrong, so be it – she’d just be presumptuous.
“Senior Sister, come and see it with me. The Wandering Market is so lively – they have automatons, shape-shifting masks, candlelight dragonflies, all sorts of curious gadgets. There are snacks like date cakes, molten custard pastries, and dried meat. You might even find rare spirit beasts and plants, or all kinds of magical treasures at low prices. If you’re lucky, you might come across something extraordinary that could help you break through to the Nascent Soul stage. There are also various magical duels – competing with others is the fastest way to gain experience and improve your cultivation. The Wanderig Market is beyond words—no one can truly capture its brilliance. Simply put, it’s a place every cultivator must visit.”
“Plus, it’s the time for the Flower Festival in Wantong City. The city will be in full bloom, vibrant and beautiful, the perfect time to enjoy the flowers. It’s one of the finest pleasures in the mortal realm. You must try the flower tea there—you’ll love it.”
As Gu Fuyou spoke, she gestured animatedly to Zhong Michu, vividly describing the scene as if trying to bring all the wonders before her eyes.
“I…” Zhong Michu was about to refuse again, as she should. The Master and several teachers had told her to leave the mountain less often. But she hesitated as the words reached her lips.
Gu Fuyou made a gesture behind her back to Ah Fu. Ah Fu moved behind Zhong Michu, nudging her downhill while making playful noises.
“See? Ah Fu wants you to go.”
Gu Fuyou gently tugged on Zhong Michu’s sleeve, pulling her downhill with a smile.
“I want you to come too. I’d be going to the Wandering Market alone this year, and I’m a bit scared. Keep me company, Senior Sister Zhong. Besides, if I run into any trouble there, I’d have to call for you anyway.”
“Gu Fuyou, I should inform the Master first…”
Seeing her give in, Gu Fuyou’s heart leaped with joy. She forgot herself again and grabbed her wrist, turning back with a smile. “No way, I want Senior Sister Zhong to be a bad student like me for once.”
Gu Fuyou is a fool, thinking Zhong Michu is really like a river clam, hard on the outside but soft on the inside. She was certain she must have been a lively person before. It was all the fault of the Xuan Miao Sect elders for making her so cold and distant.
She’s going to turn Senior Sister Zhong back!
“Ah Fu, quickly, push Senior Sister Zhong to the teleportation formation before she changes her mind.”
Gu Fuyou grabbed Zhong Michu and ran ahead, while Ah Fu pushed her from behind. Although Zhong Michu could resist, she did not.
The two of them and the beast hurried down the mountain. Gu Fuyou tossed a spirit stone into the teleportation formation, activating it. In the blink of an eye, they were transported thousands of miles away, finding themselves on the main street of Wantong City.
The buildings were grand and the roads were wide. Most passersby were cultivators, either riding rare and exotic beasts or flying on swords.
Gu Fuyou said, “Senior Sister Zhong, let’s just wander around today. I’ve already sent a message to Sister Zhu. We’ll rest at her place tonight. Ah Fu, keep up!”
On the opening day of the Wandering Market, the streets were even more bustling than usual. The clamor of voices was so loud that Gu Fuyou had to raise her voice to be heard.
Gu Fuyou didn’t walk ahead. She waited for Zhong Michu to exit the teleportation array, then she and Ah Fu moved her on either side, still worried that Zhong Michu might change her mind and leave.
Zhong Michu stopped and turned to look at her.
Gu Fuyou became nervous, blocking the way with Ah Fu: “Senior Sister Zhong, what’s wrong?”
Zhong Michu remained silent for a moment before sighing softly. “I don’t know the way.”
Only then did Gu Fuyou walk beside her, heading towards the East City.
Wantong City was built along the mountains, nestled in the Changshou Mountain Range. Just outside the eastern city was the Moon Exit Pass, beyond which lay the famous natural barrier, the Yunduan Grand Canyon.
This time, the market extended from the eastern city all the way to the entire Yunduan Grand Canyon. It was impossible to see everything in just a day or two.
By the time Gu Fuyou led Zhong Michu into the market, it was already noon, so they only strolled around the outer edges.
Still, there were countless novelties that caught their eyes.
In the past, Gu Fuyou had always come with her brother, who took the lead. Now that she had brought Zhong Michu here, and knowing that Zhong Michu had never been before while she had visited a few times, Gu Fuyou felt a sense of responsibility as a host. She was determined to ensure Zhong Michu had a good time.
Every interesting item she saw, she made sure to show Zhong Michu. Every delicious snack, she bought for Zhong Michu to taste.
After touring around, Gu Fuyou’s arms were full of snacks. She was chewing on some strange-flavored candied fruits and giggling as she looked at herself in a small mirror.
“Senior Sister Zhong, look!”
Zhong Michu turned to look. Gu Fuyou stuck out the tip of her tongue, which had turned bright green.
Zhong Michu was speechless.
Gu Fuyou then fed some of the candy to Ah Fu, and the two of them playfully messed around.
“Come and see! Freshly unearthed raw stones! Take a chance, Take a chance, millions of spirit stones could be yours! Place a bet, turn your shabby hut into an immortal’s palace!”
Zhong Michu’s attention was drawn to this. She walked to the stall and saw several stones on display, with a pile of more stones on one side. The stones were of various shapes but looked ordinary – just like regular rocks.
The chubby shopkeeper, fanning himself with a palm leaf fan, saw Zhong Michu’s elegant appearance and assumed she must be a young mistress from a prestigious cultivation family – a big client. He quickly put on a smile and said, “Young Miss, would you like to pick a couple of raw stones to try your luck? Judging by your appearance, you’re bound to have good fortune. I’m sure you’ll uncover rare treasures!”
Gu Fuyou approached and asked, “Senior Sister Zhong, do you want to try this?”
Seeing Gu Fuyou, the shopkeeper greeted her, saying, “Well, it’s a case of ‘the flood washes away the Dragon King temple’* – family not recognizing family! Turns out she’s a friend of Third Gu.”
Gu Fuyou laughed and said, “Stop pretending we’re related, we’re not family! Boss Biao, I remember that your raw stones have the lowest chance of yielding anything good.”
In this world, many spiritual items, such as Lingzhi mushrooms growing in the mountains, earth spirits like ginseng growing underground, blood pearls and corals from the seabed, as well as spiritual pills from various spirit beasts, are often encased in layers of soil and stone fragments for various reasons. Over years and years, these precious items become obscured, looking just like ordinary stones from the outside. The spiritual energy emitted by the treasures inside is almost completely blocked.
These are referred to as “raw stones” by people.
Many merchants sell these raw stones. If buyers are lucky, they might uncover a rare spirit beast’s core. If they’re unlucky, they might just find a regular spirit stone.
This type of high-risk, high-reward business excites people’s gambling instincts, making it increasingly popular. More and more people have started buying and selling raw stones.
If one manages to get a spiritual item from a raw stone, and the value of the spiritual item is higher than the price paid for the raw stone, then it’s considered a successful “hit.”
Boss Biao laughed, “That can’t be right, Third Gu. You must be mistaken.”
Gu Fuyou didn’t comment but said to Zhong Michu, “Senior Sister Zhong, if you want to try this, let’s go somewhere else. There are several other places selling raw stones, all better than here.”
“Ah, Third Gu, I swear to heaven and earth, my raw stones are absolutely the fairest deal.”
Zhong Michu’s gaze had been fixed on the table. Hearing they were about to leave, she pointed at one of the stones and said, “I want this one.”
Boss Biao’s eyes lit up, and he eagerly replied, “The young mistress has a good eye, picking out the best one at a glance.”
Gu Fuyou looked at the stone Zhong Michu had pointed to. It was about the size of an ostrich egg, round and smooth. Its surface was damp and covered with green moss, giving off a fishy smell. The spiritual energy seeping from the stone was extremely faint and barely noticeable.
It looked extremely ordinary, with nothing seemingly special about it.
Zhong Michu asked, “How much is it?”
A glint flashed in Boss Biao’s eyes. A direct inquiry about the price usually meant a wealthy customer. He quickly calculated in his mind and said, “150,000 spirit stones!”
Gu Fuyou exclaimed, “150,000? Are you trying to rob us?”
The boss replied, “Third Gu, I swear on heaven and earth, I even gave you a discount because of our relationship. This raw stone has quite a history. It comes from 1000 zhang beneath the East Sea floor, having slumbered for at least 10,000 years. Ninety-eight years ago, a great tsunami in the East Sea turned everything upside down and washed this stone ashore. A fisherman found it, and after changing hands several times, it came to me.”
“You’re just making that up!”
“I wouldn’t dare lie! There’s definitely a spiritual item inside this stone. I, Boss Biao, stake my life on it! 150,000, and not a spirit stone less.”
Zhong Michu replied, “Alright.”
But having agreed, she found herself in a difficult position. She rarely left the mountain and seldom carried spirit stones with her. This time, being suddenly called out by Gu Fuyou, she certainly hadn’t brought any.
She was about to take off the jade tablet at her waist. When traveling, a sect disciple’s identity tablet could be used in place of spirit stones.
Seeing that Zhong Michu truly wanted this raw stone, Gu Fuyou immediately stopped her hand and smiled, “Senior Sister Zhong, there’s no need. I have some spirit stones here. If you really want it, I’ll buy it for you.”
Zhong Michu put down her jade tablet and said, “Alright, I’ll repay you when we return to the sect.”
Gu Fuyou thought to herself, “Actually, you don’t need to repay me. If you like it, 150,000 spirit stones is nothing.” But she felt oddly embarrassed to say this out loud and kept quiet.
Gu Fuyou said to Boss Biao, “Alright, 150,000 it is…”
Before she could finish, a voice interrupted, “200,000. I’ll take this raw stone.”
The three of them turned to look at the speaker. He was a man who appeared to be in his thirties, with a pale face and salt-and-pepper hair. He wore a purple robe and had a blood vine and silver bracelet on his left wrist.
“Oh, if it isn’t Master Yu from the Wanyao Pavilion. This…” Boss Biao greeted him, glancing back at Gu Fuyou.
Gu Fuyou said, “Hey, there’s a thing called first come, first served.”
Yu Dongsheng slightly raised his chin and said, “300,000.”
Boss Biao immediately turned to Gu Fuyou with a smile, “Third Gu, you understand the principle of highest bidder wins, don’t you…”
Gu Fuyou knew the rule here was money talks. She snorted coldly, “If it’s about price, then fine. You think I don’t have money? 400,000.”
Yu Dongsheng calmly responded, “500,000.”
The situation was getting tense.
Gu Fuyou wasn’t foolish. Either this person was here to cause trouble, or there really was something valuable inside this raw stone.

Chapter 24
Millionaire’s Duel Over A Mysterious Stone
Gu Fuyou did some mental calculations. She had saved up about 800,000 spirit stones before, and adding the stones she got from selling medicinal pills at the Yinxue Pavilion, she had a total of 1,080,000.
Gu Fuyou cautiously proposed, “600,000?”
Yu Dongsheng countered, “700,000.”
“750,000.”
Yu Dongsheng shot her a glance and declared, “1,000,000.”
Gu Fuyou gritted her teeth and said, “1,050,000.”
Yu Dongsheng smirked, “1,100,000.”
Gu Fuyou sized up Yu Dongsheng again. In his right hand, he held a walking stick made of dead wood, with a crystal stone carved into a smiling old man’s head at the top. This suggested he held a high position in the Wanyao Pavilion. Judging by that crystal alone, he could certainly afford more than 1,100,000.
Gu Fuyou, not being as wealthy as him, stepped back to Zhong Michu’s side. She tilted her head and whispered in her ear, “Senior Sister Zhong, is that stone really worth this price?”
Zhong Michu simply nodded.
Boss Biao had never expected that this raw stone could fetch such a high price. He smiled until his facial muscles quivered, “Third Gu, do you want to raise the bid?”
Frowning, Gu Fuyou didn’t respond. Boss Biao, seeing that she might not have enough spirit stones on her, smiled and said, “Third Gu, you know the rules here of trading goods. If you’re short on cash, you can use other items to make up the difference in spirit stones. Well, I see you have a fine spirit beast beside you. It looks majestic and strong. If you’re willing to trade…”
Ah Fu stepped forward with its claws, its wolf eyes deep and menacing, its fangs gleaming white. It let out a low growl, sending a gust of foul wind that rattled the nearby signboards.
Boss Biao stepped back and laughed, “Third Gu’s spirit beast sure has a big temper, seems hard to tame, not easy to keep…”
Gu Fuyou glanced sideways at Ah Fu. Feeling her gaze, Ah Fu turned its head and met Gu Fuyou’s appraising look. It actually thought Gu Fuyou was displeased with its big appetite and disobedience, and was considering selling it.
Ah Fu raised its head, its muzzle brushing against Gu Fuyou’s chin, and began licking her face frantically, whimpering. If it could speak, it would surely be saying, “I’m very well-behaved.”
Boss Biao said, “Third Gu, if you’re not selling, then this stone will go to…”
Interrupted by Ah Fu’s antics, Gu Fuyou had a flash of inspiration. “Wait!” She grabbed Ah Fu by the scruff of its neck, pulled it away, and took something out of her storage bag. She handed it to Boss Biao and asked, “Boss Biao, how much do you think this is worth?”
Boss Biao’s eyes widened in recognition, “Ah! Dizang meat!”
This was the piece of Dizang meat that Gu Fuyou had plucked from the corner of Ah Fu’s mouth earlier. She hadn’t known how to deal with it properly, so she had kept it until now.
Boss Biao examined the Dizang meat carefully, then called a friend to watch his stall. Holding the flesh in one hand and the raw stone in the other, he said, “Please, follow me.”
Boss Biao led the group of three people and one beast to a building. Unlike the neighboring square buildings, this one was circular, with four floors, each adorned with glazed eaves.
Upon entering, many people were bustling about, and they walked straight to the central courtyard, where there was a spacious dueling platform with protective formations below and no cover above, revealing the blue and white sky.
Boss Biao led everyone to the top floor. Next to the grand entrance of the hall on this side hung a red flag with a golden border, with a ‘pawn’ character woven in gold.
Zhong Michu looked across to the other side and saw that each room opposite them, across the courtyard, also had a flag hanging, with the character for “gamble” on it.
As they entered, a servant in grey short robes immediately came to greet them. Many of the people coming and going here wore similar attire.
Walking beside Zhong Michu, Gu Fuyou explained to her, “These are all people from the merchant association. This side is the pawnshop, and the opposite side is the gambling house.”
As they approached the counter, an elderly man picked up the Dizang meat that Boss Biao had handed over. After studying it for a while, he put down his tools and said, “500,000 spirit stones.”
“What? Only 500,000? Even though this Dizang meat doesn’t look appealing, given its size, it should be at least seven hundred thousand!” Gu Fuyou exclaimed, rushing forward and leaning over the counter, almost as if she wanted to climb over and argue face-to-face with the old man.
The elderly man calmly explained, “Third Gu, if it were in the past, this piece of Dizang meat would be worth at least seven hundred thousand spirit stones. But now, the son of the Xu Ling Sect hunted a whole Dizang beast in Xian Luo, which has brought down the market price a lot. You know, the rarer something is, the more valuable.”
Cursing in her heart, Gu Fuyou thought, why is Zuo Tianlang everywhere?
“Fine, 500,000 it is,” she conceded. “Add that to the original 1,050,000. Boss Biao, that’s a total of 1,550,000 spirit stones for this raw stone.”
Zhong Michu and Ah Fu stood to the side. Although Zhong Michu wasn’t so out of touch with the mortal world that she didn’t know spirit stones were needed for purchases, her privileged upbringing meant she wasn’t sensitive to prices. She didn’t know what was considered expensive or cheap. She had no clear concept of what 1,550,000 spirit stones meant or what it could buy.
As a result, she couldn’t intervene in these matters and left everything to Gu Fuyou. She stroked Ah Fu’s head, quietly waiting with the beast as she watched Gu Fuyou negotiate with Boss Biao.
Yu Dongsheng interjected, “I’ll match that.”
It seemed there was no end to this.
However, Boss Biao’s demeanor changed from his usual money-loving attitude to a serious expression. “If both of you are so intent on this raw stone that you’ve raised the price by over a million, and neither is willing to back down, there are other rules we must follow.”
Yu Dongsheng looked at Gu Fuyou, smirking slightly, “Naturally.”
Gu Fuyou, looking distressed, turned to Zhong Michu, “Senior Sister Zhong…”
The rules of this market were arranged by the merchant association, including some unspoken ones. One such rule was designed to prevent artificially inflated prices.
Prices in the market are naturally set by the seller. The seller can decide if items go to the first buyer or to the highest bidder.
If it was the latter, and the bidding reached ten times the original price with neither party willing to back down, a different form of competition would be used.
The two parties would engage in a duel of magical arts, with the merchant association as the referee. The winner would obtain the item
This was, after all, the survival rule of this world – the strong devour the weak.
Gu Fuyou explained this to Zhong Michu. Now that she and Yu Dongsheng had driven the price of the raw stone over a million, it was no longer about who could pay more, but who was stronger. They either had to give up or duel Yu Dongsheng for the stone.
Boss Biao approached and said, “Third Gu, I see Master Yu is determined to win. He’s advanced to the later stages of the Golden Core. If the young city lord were here, it might be different, but as it stands, you alone can’t win against him in a duel… Why don’t you let your friend choose another raw stone? I’ll give you a half-price discount.”
Gu Fuyou wasn’t entirely certain about what was inside the raw stone, so she didn’t feel a strong need to obtain it. However, Zhong Michu wanted it, so she tried her best to get it for her.
But now, the situation had evolved beyond just paying with spirit stones.
A duel required cultivation. If the opponent’s cultivation level was lower, it wouldn’t be a problem, and Zhong Michu could handle it herself. But Yu Dongsheng was already at the late Golden Core stage. Even if Zhong Michu participated, winning would be extremely difficult.
Zhong Michu lowered her eyes slightly, remaining silent.
Zhong Michu was a person of few words and expressions, but after spending time with her, one would find that she was actually quite easy to understand, like now.
Seeing Zhong Michu’s expression, Gu Fuyou didn’t want to disappoint her. After pondering for a moment, an idea struck her. She pulled Zhong Michu aside and said, “Senior Sister Zhong, if you really want it, I have a plan. It can’t guarantee victory, but it could increase our chances of winning. However, it might put you in an uncomfortable position…”
Zhong Michu asked, “What’s the plan?”
Gu Fuyou leaned closer, whispering into her ear.
Being so close, Gu Fuyou’s fragrance was very strong, causing Zhong Michu to unconsciously hold her breath.
As they stood side by side, Zhong Michu’s gaze fell on Gu Fuyou’s shoulder, where she could see half of a mark peeking out from under her clothes. The faint traces still showed the shape of the wound – it was a bite mark…
Zhong Michu felt a moment of unease, like a child who had done something wrong and was afraid of being discovered by an elder, not knowing what to do.
She stepped back slightly and said, “Alright.”
Gu Fuyou hadn’t expected her to agree so readily. She was a bit taken aback and felt quite awkward. “Okay, then… then that’s the plan.”
Gu Fuyou turned to Boss Biao and said, “Boss Biao, I want that raw stone. I’m willing to duel for it.”
“This…” Boss Biao saw her determination and felt he couldn’t dissuade her. He sighed and said, “Very well.”
Boss Biao then led them to the gambling house. As the three waited outside, Boss Biao headed inside.
After a while, three servants came out carrying red-lacquered wooden trays, followed by a woman in red clothing.
This woman in red was to be the official witness of their duel. She approached gracefully and asked, “Which two esteemed guests will be dueling for the raw stone?”
Yu Dongsheng and Gu Fuyou stepped forward. The woman said, “Please sign the life-and-death agreement.”
On the three red-lacquered trays, one held the raw stone, while the other two contained writing materials and a life-and-death agreement.
This duel didn’t necessarily mean fighting to the death, but accidents could happen. Signing the agreement meant that whatever happened on the dueling platform, be it injury or death, would not be anyone else’s responsibility.
Gu Fuyou pulled Zhong Michu forward and said to the woman in red, “Sister, she needs to sign too.”
The woman in red smiled slightly and said, “Young lady, duels are one-on-one. There’s no precedent for three people entering the arena.”
Gu Fuyou asked Ah Fu to wait where it was, then led Zhong Michu towards the woman in red. She said, “We’d like to ask you to verify whether we can enter as a pair. However, this verification requires undressing. As we’re young women, it wouldn’t be appropriate in public. Could we move to a more private location?”
The woman in red looked puzzled for a moment, but then resumed her gentle smile and said elegantly, “If that’s the case, please follow me.”
She then turned to Yu Dongsheng and said, “Sir, please wait a moment.”
Yu Dongsheng frowned in displeasure but didn’t say anything, watching as the three women headed towards the inner hall.
The woman in red led the two to a room and asked, “May I know what kind of verification you need, young ladies?”
Gu Fuyou replied with a smile, “While the duel is one-on-one, summoning a spirit beast is allowed. She isn’t breaking the rules by joining because she’s my spirit beast. I feared you wouldn’t believe me, so I wanted you to verify it.”
Upon hearing this, the woman in red indeed looked surprised and puzzled. However, the merchant association’s service was known for its discretion – they never asked questions they shouldn’t or interfered in matters that weren’t their business.
So even though she had her doubts, she didn’t ask any more about it and only said, “If that’s the case, I’ll need to verify the beast mark.”
The woman in red opened the door and said, “Miss, please come in.”
Zhong Michu entered, and Gu Fuyou also wanted to follow. However, after receiving a glance from Zhong Michu, Gu Fuyou pursed her lips, stepping back and watching as the woman in red entered the room and closed the door.
When forming a contract with a spirit beast, there would always be a beast mark. Gu Fuyou had asked Zhong Michu beforehand and learned that she had one, which was why she dared to ask for this verification. Otherwise, no one would believe that Zhong Michu was her spirit beast.
Gu Fuyou wondered where on Zhong Michu’s body the beast mark was located. These marks usually took the shape of the spirit beast’s true form. Could Zhong Michu’s mark be in the shape of a graceful beauty?
Gu Fuyou was very curious and wanted to see it herself, but fearing it might upset Zhong Michu, she obediently waited outside.
After a while, the door opened, and the two women came out one after another.
Zhong Michu was adjusting her collar. The woman in red looked at Gu Fuyou with a respectful expression and said, “It is indeed a beast mark.”
The woman in red no longer had any doubts, but as a formality, she asked Gu Fuyou to perform the summoning formation for Zhong Michu once on the spot. Then she led the two back to the outer hall and announced to everyone, “Both can enter the arena. Please sign the life-and-death agreement.”
Yu Dongsheng protested, “How is this reasonable?”
The woman in red explained, “They have a master and contracted spirit beast relationship, so both can enter the arena.”
Yu Dongsheng sneered, “She’s clearly a human. Since when do humans become spirit beasts? Are you lying to my face?”
The woman in red smiled and said, “Please trust the merchant association’s verification. Or you can choose to forfeit the match. Naturally, the raw stone would then go to the other party.”
Yu Dongsheng’s eyes narrowed. After a moment, he snorted coldly, “Fine, two people it is.”
“One is in the mid-stage of the Golden Core, the other at the peak of Qi Practicing. Does it really make a difference if there’s one more or one less?”
Chapter 25
A Duel to the Death
After the two sides signed the life-and-death agreement, the sound of golden bells rang, ringing twelve times in succession. The sound was clear, heard both inside and outside.
Outside the gambling house, a viewing platform stood. A woman in red clothes announced from the platform, “Place your bets for the duel on the fighting stage. All bets are final, and no late entries will be accepted.”
Shortly after the golden bell rang, people started to arrive gradually, and the multi-story building soon became bustling with activity.
The gambling house had a rule: for any duel, the house would act as the banker and open the betting.
This first match between Gu Fuyou and Yu Dongsheng was the first of the day, so it was relatively quiet. During the busiest times in the market, the opening of a betting round would see the viewing platform packed shoulder to shoulder, without an inch of space to spare.
After signing the life-and-death agreement, both sides began their preparations.
Gu Fuyou gazed at Zhong Michu’s long hair, resting her chin on her hand, deep in thought.
Zhong Michu asked, “What’s the matter?”
“Senior Sister Zhong, for the upcoming duel, it would be better if you tie up your hair and sleeves,” suggested Gu Fuyou.
Zhong Michu touched the strands of hair flowing down her shoulder, “I can manage my hair, but how should I tie up the sleeves?”
Gu Fuyou rummaged through her storage bag and pulled out an arm strap. Realizing from Zhong Michu’s question that she didn’t know how to use it, Gu Fuyou stepped forward to help her.
Unaware of Gu Fuyou’s intentions, Zhong Michu stepped back when she approached.
Gu Fuyou laughed, “Senior Sister, don’t shy away. I’m just helping you tie your sleeves.”
Realizing her intention, Zhong Michu no longer retreated. Gu Fuyou said, “Stretch out your arm.”
Zhong Michu hesitated momentarily before extending her arm. Gu Fuyou pushed up the sleeves, revealing a portion of her forearm. They were not entirely delicate like most women’s; years of sword practice had made the skin firm, with beautifully defined muscle lines.
Gu Fuyou stole a glance and silently admired, “Beautiful, as expected of Senior Sister Zhong, flawless as white jade; she’s beautiful everywhere.”
After tying her sleeves, Gu Fuyou went to check the odds. Against Yu Dongsheng, he had 1-to-1 odds, while hers were 1-to-10.
By the time she returned, Yu Dongsheng had already entered the arena, and the golden bells rang again.
Gu Fuyou took a deep breath and produced two talismans. She gave one to Zhong Michu and used her sword to prick her fingertip, dropping a bead of blood onto the talisman she held.
Watching Zhong Michu, she saw her make a similar cut on her finger, smearing her blood onto her talisman.
They then exchanged the talismans. Gu Fuyou took the one with Zhong Michu’s blood and placed it against her chest, while Zhong Michu tucked the one with Gu Fuyou’s blood into her waistband.
Zhong Michu softly called out, “Gengchen.”
With a flash of the sword’s light, Zhong Michu grasped the sword hilt and handed it to Gu Fuyou, who accepted it.
The one meter long sword, how heavy can it be?
The sword felt incredibly heavy, as if she were holding a mountain, weighing over a thousand pounds.
She gripped the hilt, using all her strength, her face turning red, but she couldn’t lift Gengchen.
Weapons of external cultivators possess spirits. Apart from their owners, others can only wield them if their cultivation level surpasses that of the owner.
Gu Fuyou pleaded, “Good Gengchen, dear Gengchen, we need to get along well from now on. Don’t! Be! So! Stubborn!”
Gu Fuyou emphasized each word with a tug, but the sword didn’t budge at all.
Zhong Michu coldly called out, “Gengchen.”
As soon as Zhong Michu called out, the long sword suddenly seemed to come alive. It shot up into the air, surrounded by a spiritual glow that made it appear several times larger. The blade turned, lifting Gu Fuyou and flying down from the viewing platform.
Zhong Michu followed closely behind, her toes barely touching the ground as she rode the wind down. The two of them, along with the sword, landed on the dueling stage.
The golden bell rang three times. Spectators gathered at the railings of all four floors, with the woman in red standing on the highest viewing platform. She announced in a clear voice, “The duel will continue until one side surrenders or is unable to continue fighting. Only then will the winner be determined.”
As soon as she finished speaking, cheers and shouts of encouragement erupted from the audience.
Yu Dongsheng tapped his withered wooden staff on the ground, causing spiritual light to flood the dueling stage.
Gu Fuyou held the sword at the ready, looking every bit the part of a skilled swordswoman. She said to Zhong Michu, “Once the fight starts, I won’t be able to protect you. To avoid getting caught in the crossfire, please stand at the edge of the stage.”
Zhong Michu did as she was told, retreating to the edge of the dueling platform.
Yu Dongsheng’s gaze swept over the two of them, his eyes slightly clouded. Finally, his gaze settled on Gu Fuyou, and he snorted coldly, “A sword cultivator? If you can’t get close to me, what use is your sword cultivation?”
As he spoke, tree vines as thick as barrels erupted from the spiritual light. The vines moved with lifelike agility, each one resembling a giant python ready to swallow the sky.
The Wanyao Pavilion cultivated various spiritual plants for refining medicinal pills, so naturally, most of its members had water, wood, or fire spiritual roots. Yu Dongsheng possessed both water and wood spiritual roots.
Facing Gu Fuyou, he didn’t immediately use his spiritual power to suppress her. Instead, he cautiously kept his distance, protecting himself and preparing for battle. Strangely, he paid little attention to Zhong Michu.
Gu Fuyou wielded Gengchen, cutting down the incoming vines one by one with continuous and crisp sword strikes.
To onlookers, she appeared to be a skilled sword cultivator with no small amount of power.
Little did they know, it wasn’t the person controlling the sword, but the sword controlling the person.
Gu Fuyou was merely maintaining a stance. The real control of Gengchen and the contribution of spiritual power came from Zhong Michu.
Gu Fuyou’s legs were already weakening under the unconsciously emitted spiritual pressure of the two Golden Core cultivators. She felt nauseous and on the verge of vomiting.
But Yu Dongsheng had taken the bait, so no matter how uncomfortable she felt, Gu Fuyou had to persevere. She couldn’t reveal any weakness before Zhong Michu made her move.
Although Yu Dongsheng was at the late stage of Golden Core and proud of his abilities, he wasn’t overly arrogant. At first, he was merely testing the waters cautiously.
External cultivation was more difficult than internal cultivation. There was a saying in the world about the principle of slow accumulation leading to sudden breakthroughs. At the same level of cultivation, external cultivators were generally more powerful than internal cultivators.
If the cultivation levels were similar, internal cultivators typically avoided close combat with external cultivators.
Therefore, Yu Dongsheng held back and didn’t want to go all out from the start. But this was precisely what Gu Fuyou had anticipated.
Zhong Michu had already moved from Gu Fuyou’s side to the edge of the dueling platform where Yu Dongsheng was.
Yu Dongsheng noticed but remained indifferent, not considering her a threat. He summoned his spirit beast with a tap of his wooden staff.
It was a colorful venomous snake, its tongue flickering as it slithered out from the summoning circle. Slightly lifting its head, it was as tall as Zhong Michu.
This venomous snake was in the early Body Tempering Stage, more than enough to deal with Gu Fuyou. However, it was up against Zhong Michu.
When the snake first emerged, it bared its fangs, its eyes sharp and its head held high. But as soon as it approached Zhong Michu, it immediately flattened itself against the ground submissively.
The spectators on the highest level of the viewing platform found this strange. Someone asked, “Why is Master Yu being so cautious against a Qi Practicing cultivator, while completely ignoring the Golden Core cultivator behind him? What’s the logic in this?”
Another added, “And that spirit beast must be at least at the Body Tempering stage. Why isn’t it resisting at all, allowing that Golden Core cultivator to approach its master’s back?”
“Are they fixing the match?”
Boss Biao, fanning himself, chuckled, “I don’t think so. From what I see… hmm… it looks more like they’ve fallen for the ‘one leaf blinds the eye’ trick.”
The woman in red commented, “Boss Biao, you have a keen eye.”
Boss Biao stroked his chin, “I just don’t understand why Master Yu’s spirit beast isn’t putting up any resistance.”
The woman in red gazed at the figures on the dueling platform, smiled slightly, but remained silent.
On the dueling platform, Yu Dongsheng kept probing, but Gu Fuyou only defended and didn’t attack. As the battle progressed, she looked increasingly panicked, her breathing erratic and her footwork disorganized.
Yu Dongsheng finally sensed something amiss. He used half of his spiritual power to control the vines, lashing out with great force. Gu Fuyou felt a sharp pain in her wrists and lost her grip on Gengchen, which flew to the side.
The vines wrapped around Gu Fuyou’s waist, making it difficult for her to breathe.
Yu Dongsheng, as if waking from a dream, exclaimed with a change of expression, “One Leaf Blinds The Eye!”
He had been deceived by such a simple trick.
The so-called One Leaf Blinds The Eye technique makes it hard for the opponent to think clearly.
Yu Dongsheng could see the cultivation levels of both Zhong Michu and Gu Fuyou, but under the influence of this technique, his perception became confused. His mind only remembered that one was at the Golden Core stage and the other at Qi Practicing, but he couldn’t clearly discern which was which.
At the beginning of the duel, Gu Fuyou’s statement seemed to be directed at Zhong Michu, but in reality, it was meant for Yu Dongsheng’s ears.
By having Zhong Michu stand behind her in a protective stance, Gu Fuyou further reinforced the illusion.
Already affected by the technique, Yu Dongsheng’s thinking became rigid. The information he gleaned from Gu Fuyou’s words led him to believe that Gu Fuyou was stronger than Zhong Michu. This deliberate misdirection naturally made him assume Gu Fuyou was at the Golden Core stage and Zhong Michu at Qi Practicing.
This One Leaf Blinds The Eye spell was hidden in the talismans that Gu Fuyou and Zhong Michu had exchanged before entering the arena, each infused with their own aura.
The strength of a talisman depends on the cultivation level of its creator. Given Gu Fuyou’s cultivation level, her “One Leaf Blinds The Eye” talisman was certainly not as convincing as those made by great masters.
The gap in cultivation between her and Yu Dongsheng was too large; this talisman would not have withstood any real scrutiny.
If Yu Dongsheng had approached Gu Fuyou closely or exerted his spiritual pressure from the start, her ruse would have been immediately exposed.
However, Gu Fuyou knew that people in the Wanyao Pavilion were divided into five classes, distinguished by the inlays on their blood vine bracelets. From highest to lowest: jade, gold, silver, bronze, and those without bracelets who were apprentices or subordinates.
Yu Dongsheng wore a silver-inlaid blood vine bracelet, indicating he had dozens of apprentices and subordinates under him. His status was not low, and with his dual water and wood spiritual roots at the late Golden Core stage, he was at the peak of his confidence.
Given his pride in his status, he wouldn’t seriously consider or pay much attention to a Qi Practicing cultivator joining the duel.
Moreover, working at the Wanyao Pavilion, tending to spirit plants that required precise amounts of water and sunlight, and refining pills that needed exact fire control and ingredient measurements, Yu Dongsheng was bound to be a meticulous and cautious person.
Such a cautious individual would likely choose a step-by-step approach in a duel rather than rushing in aggressively.
Indeed, it played out as Gu Fuyou had anticipated. Upon realizing one of them was a sword cultivator, Yu Dongsheng immediately distanced himself, set up barriers, and probed cautiously.
By neither approaching the two nor using his full power from the start, he missed the best opportunity to break through Gu Fuyou’s fragile illusion. Despite its weakness, he allowed himself to be deceived.
Had Yu Dongsheng deviated from his usual behavior in any way, Gu Fuyou’s plan would have fallen apart.
But he didn’t.
Gu Fuyou’s “One Leaf Blinds the Eye” technique lasted barely the time it takes to drink a cup of tea. Given her limited skills, Yu Dongsheng eventually noticed something was amiss, but by then, it had served its purpose.
Zhong Michu had already circled behind Yu Dongsheng, and his spirit beast dared not move. With a flicker of Zhong Michu’s spiritual power, the vines instantly lost their moisture and withered rapidly.
When Gengchen was knocked from Gu Fuyou’s hands, the sword spun in the air and returned to Zhong Michu’s grasp.
As soon as Zhong Michu gripped the sword hilt, she attacked with lightning speed.
Yu Dongsheng swung his withered staff, unleashing a burst of spiritual power throughout his body.
Unable to withstand such overwhelming pressure, Gu Fuyou coughed up blood, which also flowed from her ears. Even with her body covered in defensive talismans, she felt as if her internal organs were being crushed to a bloody pulp.
Noticing this from the corner of her eye, Zhong Michu immediately used her left hand to summon a protective wind barrier around Gu Fuyou. This was to prevent Gu Fuyou from sustaining severe injuries before the duel’s outcome was decided.
Holding her sword in her right hand, Zhong Michu took a step forward. Ice crystals blossomed beneath her feet, instantly spreading and freezing the oncoming wave of vines solid.
With a single slash of her sword, the ice shattered, and she charged through.
Originally just a few steps away from Yu Dongsheng, Zhong Michu now found herself right in front of him after breaking through the layer of vines.
While Golden Core cultivators can cast spells almost instantly, their sword techniques are even faster.
Even though Zhong Michu’s cultivation was slightly lower than Yu Dongsheng’s, now that she was in close proximity, their chances in combat were about even.
Moreover, Yu Dongsheng had lost the initiative and was still mentally disoriented from the “One Leaf Blinds The Eye” technique, unable to fully recover his composure.
He couldn’t avoid Zhong Michu’s sword strike.
Zhong Michu held her sword to Yu Dongsheng’s throat, slightly out of breath from her all-out attack.
Yu Dongsheng looked intently at Zhong Michu and asked, “Are you both an internal and external cultivator?”
Before Zhong Michu could answer, he shook his head and chuckled ruefully, “I admit defeat. I’ve lost.”
The golden bell on the viewing platform rang once more, and the woman in red announced, “The match is decided.”
A wave of boos and sighs of disappointment swept through the audience.
Gu Fuyou’s unexpected victory had caused many to lose their bets.
Zhong Michu stepped back, bowed respectfully to Yu Dongsheng, then ran over to Gu Fuyou.
Gu Fuyou, dazed from the pressure of both cultivators’ spiritual power, had just regained consciousness to find Zhong Michu shaking her.
Upon seeing Gu Fuyou wake up, Zhong Michu’s eyes sparkled, her face lighting up with a radiant smile, “Gu Fuyou, we won.”
She had never engaged in such a life-or-death duel before. Winning against someone of equal cultivation would have been exhilarating, but defeating someone a level above her was not only thrilling but deeply satisfying.
She had believed her heart to be as still and deep as an ancient well, immune to life’s ripples. Yet in this moment, she felt her pulse quicken, her breath catch, and a surge of exhilaration course through her entire being.
Gu Fuyou saw her smile again, but this time it was different. Before, it had been quiet and gentle, but now it was full of energy and confidence. It was bright and dazzling.
Believing she must still be dreaming, Gu Fuyou lay back down and mumbled, “I don’t think I’m fully awake yet.”
Gu Fuyou thought she might still be in a daze and laid back down, saying, “I might not have woken up yet.”
Chapter 26
Tears Under the Moonlit Tree
Zhong Michu asked, “Gu Fuyou?”
Gu Fuyou suddenly stood up, belatedly realizing what had happened, and excitedly hugged her, “Ahhhh!!! We won!”
Zhong Michu stiffened for a moment but didn’t push her away. After a moment, she gently patted Gu Fuyou’s back and said, “Yes, we won.”
“Senior Sister Zhong, you’re a genius. You’re amazing! It’s all thanks to you…”
Zhong Michu helped her up and said, “No, Gu Fuyou. You’re the amazing one.”
Gu Fuyou was using her sleeve to wipe the blood from her chin when Zhong Michu took out a handkerchief and offered it to her.
Taking it, Gu Fuyou grinned, “Thank you, Senior Sister.”
After carelessly wiping the blood from her chin and ears, she laughed and said, “What’s so amazing about someone like me? I lost to Master Yu in just one move.”
“I’m useless, you know that. I’m pretty good at causing trouble though.” Gu Fuyou added. She was the type of person who acted proud when others looked down on her, but became shy when genuinely praised.
Zhong Michu shook her head and said seriously, “You were the one who spotted the flaw in the Ruizhu Palace’s formation. You were also the one who set up the formation to escape the inner layer of Xian Luo. And now in this duel, if I were to directly compete with that person, I might not have won. It was you who came up with a strategy to create a winning situation. Elder Liuhe said you have some cleverness and only some insight into formations, but I don’t think that’s the case. You’re very intelligent, and you shouldn’t underestimate yourself.”
They had been here for half a day, and now it was approaching dusk. The sunset was beautiful, with warm orange light streaming in from the west side of the courtyard, scattering golden fragments across the ground.
The light fell on Zhong Michu, casting a soft, warm glow that made her appear even more ethereal.
Zhong Michu said, “Gu Fuyou, you are a genius.”
Staring blankly at her, Gu Fuyou responded in disbelief, “What… what did you just say?”
Zhong Michu repeated, “You are a genius, we won because of you…”
She noticed Gu Fuyou’s fair neck, soft ears, and her pale face visibly turning bright red.
Gu Fuyou covered her face, stumbling slightly, and made indistinct sounds in her throat as if trying to suppress a shout.
After a while, Gu Fuyou peeked at Zhong Michu through her fingers and said very softly, “Say it again.”
Zhong Michu said, “You’re a genius?”
Gu Fuyou insisted, “Say it again.”
“You are a genius.”
“Say it again.”
“You’re a genius.”
Gu Fuyou absolutely loved Zhong Michu’s incredible patience.
Others might say that Zhong Michu’s emotions and voice were usually flat, that she was cold and distant, without warmth.
But at this moment, even though her voice was just as even as always, to Gu Fuyou, it was the warmest sound in the world, the kindest words ever spoken.
She didn’t care whether Zhong Michu liked it or not, she tightly hugged her arm and showed a contented smile, “Senior Sister Zhong, I like you so much.”
Zhong Michu didn’t understand the source of Gu Fuyou’s joy, but seeing the smile on her face, she couldn’t help but smile back.
The two returned to the gambling house and collected the raw stone.
On top of that, before entering the competition, Gu Fuyou had pawned her identity jade plaque for one million spirit stones and bet on herself. Now, having won the raw stone, she had also earned an extra ten million spirit stones.
When she tried to give Zhong Michu half, Zhong Michu said, “I’m not good with handling money; you should keep it.”
“Then you can ask me for it when you need to use it,” Gu Fuyou replied.
As they were talking, the woman in red approached and handed them two wooden plaques, saying, “Here are the additional rewards for the winners of the duel, the entry tokens for Canyon Racing.”
Gu Fuyou took them, overjoyed once again.
Zhong Michu asked, “What’s the Canyon Race?”
Gu Fuyou said, “Senior Zhong, have you heard of horse racing? It’s similar to that. You ride your own spirit beast to the finish line, and if you win, the rewards are substantial.”
In the past, when she visited with her eldest brother, he always received the entry pass, and she could only watch from the stands. Every time she watched, she longed to participate.
Gu Fuyou happily tucked away the passes and led Ah Fu and Zhong Michu downstairs.
Across the courtyard, on the other side of the stairs, someone suddenly stopped and looked over.
The person behind him also stopped and asked, “Young Master Zuo, what’s the matter?”
Zuo Tianlang said, “I think that person looks like Gu Fuyou. I thought the affairs in Xiaoyao City were busy this year, and Gu Shuangqing shouldn’t have been able to get away…”
As he spoke, he lifted his chin towards the person behind him, “She’s coming down from the gambling house. Beard Slave, go to the gambling house and ask around to see if that person is really Gu Fuyou.”
Beard Slave bowed his head in acknowledgment and bounded up the stairs like a gust of wind. He returned shortly after, saying, “It’s the third Miss Gu. The young city lord isn’t with her. She came with another person, a new face. They just won a bet in a duel against Yu Dongsheng from Wanyao Pavilion.”
“They won?” Zuo Tianlang raised an eyebrow. “That means she has an entry pass for the Canyon Race now.”
Zuo Tianlang pondered for a moment, his eyes glinting with an idea. “Zhong Yi, come here.”
A middle-aged man wearing a headband with a long beard stepped forward: “Young Master.”
Zuo Tianlang spun his folding fan, covered his mouth, and leaned in to say: “You do this…”
After giving his instructions, he said: “Go now.”
Zhong Yi bowed and said: “Yes.” He then took his leave to carry out the orders.
Meanwhile, by the time Gu Fuyou brought Zhong Michu back to Yinxue Pavilion, the sky had turned dark blue.
Because the Yinxue Pavilion was noisy and crowded, Zhu Ruo worried the girls wouldn’t be comfortable there. Hence, she arranged for them to stay in a quiet small courtyard behind the street.
When Gu Fuyou brought Zhong Michu over, Zhu Rou naturally had to welcome them. Only a few people had met Zhong Michu before, but after the girls in the house exaggerated Zhong Michu’s elegance, this time, people came to see her in droves, surrounding her completely.
They all came to see her as if she were some rare curiosity.
The girls pulled Zhong Michu into their fun for quite a while. Gu Fuyou had to use all her wits to finally rescue Zhong Michu and return to the small courtyard.
The courtyard was simple and elegant, far away from the crowd.
In the middle of the courtyard, there was a locust tree with lush branches and leaves, casting a dense shade.
Gu Fuyou and Zhong Michu’s rooms faced each other. They wished each other good night and retired to their respective rooms to rest.
With the moon shining bright, the distant noises faded, leaving only peace.
Gu Fuyou tossed and turned, unable to sleep until midnight.
She got up, wearing her robe with her hair loose, and sat staring at Ah Fu, who was curled up sleeping by the bed, for a while.
After a moment, she got out of bed, slipped on her shoes, and opened the door to a floor bathed in moonlight.
She walked out and sat down under the locust tree, her body hidden in the shadows.
She gazed at Zhong Michu’s door, her eyes welling up with tears. Before she knew it, tears were rolling down her cheeks.
With a creak, the door opposite opened. Zhong Michu, fully dressed, looked over and said, “Gu Fuyou?”
Zhong Michu hadn’t slept. She was in the middle of her meditation when she heard a noise and came out to check, only to see someone sitting in the dense darkness under the locust tree.
Zhong Michu approached, standing in the moonlight, “What’s wrong?”
Gu Fuyou had originally wanted to say, “Why did you come out? Did I disturb you?” to cover it up.
But she was too upset, her throat choked up, and she couldn’t speak. She was afraid that if she opened her mouth, she would burst into uncontrollable sobs.
She didn’t want to cry in front of others. Crying alone was fine, but crying in front of others was too embarrassing.
Zhong Michu asked, “Is it the injury from the duel that hasn’t healed? Are you still in pain?”
“No…”
As soon as the word came out, she could no longer hold back and began to sob in front of Zhong Michu.
Tears streamed down, and she tried wiping them away, but the more she wiped, the more they flowed.
She tried suppressing her emotions, but it only made her feel worse.
Zhong Michu pressed again: “What’s wrong?”
Gu Fuyou was also asking herself what was wrong, saying it out loud was too ridiculous.
Feeling she had already embarrassed herself enough in front of Zhong Michu, she gave up trying to hold back and cried with tears and snot flowing freely.
While crying, she said: “I… it’s the first time, the first time someone has praised me like this…”
Gu Fuyou looked at Zhong Michu through tear-filled eyes, her voice catching as she sobbed, “Senior Zhong, it’s the first time someone has called me a genius.”
“I’m so happy, so, so happy…” she covered her face, her restrained sobs transforming into loud crying, as if she was trying to release everything pent up inside her.
From birth until now, the word she had heard most often was “regret.” How could Gu Wanpeng, a tiger of a father, have such an unremarkable daughter?
She thought that after all, she was part of the Gu family, and deep down, she was proud. Even knowing her aptitude was ordinary, she refused to remain mediocre.
She had rebelled before, cultivating desperately, using all kinds of spirit pills and elixirs. Her family gave her the best resources to improve her cultivation. She practiced day and night, cultivating, cultivating, and nothing but cultivating, forsaking food and sleep…
However, no matter what she did, her cultivation level only increased slowly. No matter how many spirit medicines were used, there was no noticeable improvement.
Years of hard work and the best resources couldn’t compare to her brother’s one night of meditation.
The outcome of hard work not being reciprocated is despair.
Maybe when she was alone, she could comfort herself that even a little progress, a little improvement, was still progress and improvement.
But she couldn’t do it. She couldn’t keep lying to herself.
Beside her was a highly talented brother, worlds apart from her, constantly reminding her that it wasn’t that she wasn’t trying hard enough, but that she simply couldn’t do it.
She can endure a month, a year, two years, but she can’t bear ten years, twenty years.
She once had naive fantasies of being as brilliant as her brother. She also loved cultivation and hoped that one day she would achieve great mastery and leave her name in history.
In the end, reality left her with nothing but pain. Whenever she cultivated, she felt miserable.
For a while, to escape, she gave up cultivation entirely. She couldn’t bear to touch anything related to cultivation. She learned cooking from the family chef, thinking being a kitchen master wouldn’t be bad. She learned embroidery from seamstresses, tried carpentry, read medical books, wanting to become a healer.
Her father gradually thought she lacked focus, dabbling in everything but mastering nothing, abandoning cultivation and only loving to play around.
In the end, she still couldn’t resign herself to mediocrity.
In this unwillingness, she came into contact with formations. The first time she witnessed how the ancient formations could harness the power of heaven and earth, altering yin and yang, it was enough to amaze her for a lifetime.
She started to work tirelessly again. When she first researched and created a small, completely new formation on her own, she happily went to show Gu Wanpeng.
There’s a story in Xiaoyao City called “The Boy Who Cried Wolf.”
After Gu Fuyou had repeatedly abandoned important things for trivial matters, Gu Wanpeng no longer took her seriousness seriously, still treating it as if she was just playing around.
Gu Wanpeng only said, “Focusing on your cultivation would be better than anything else.”
This cold response was undoubtedly like pouring a bucket of cold water on Gu Fuyou’s passionate heart.
Gu Wanpeng didn’t understand Gu Fuyou’s love for formations, a love that could last a lifetime, so he wouldn’t know that Gu Fuyou was begging for his approval, hoping for his praise.
From the very beginning until now, Gu Fuyou had rarely heard praise from others. Even when she did, it was often just empty flattery from ordinary people who didn’t practice cultivation.
Cultivators value cultivation ability the most. Without cultivation, one can’t create powerful formations; without cultivation, life is limited to a hundred years, beauty fades in the blink of an eye, and there’s not enough time to accomplish anything.
Understanding how to set up formations with the right timing, location, yin and yang, and the five elements is considered useless without the necessary cultivation.
Gu Fuyou said, “Even if you’re just trying to comfort me…”
Zhong Michu crouched in front of her and said, “Gu Fuyou, I don’t lie. I called you a genius because I truly believe you are one.”
Gu Fuyou sobbed uncontrollably, shaking her head, “No, Senior Zhong. It’s not like that. I… I know that setting up formations, altering yin and yang and the five elements, using the forces of nature – these methods don’t require talent. As long as you work hard enough, memorize the conditions, characteristics, habits, uses, and origins of those formations, anyone can do what I do with enough effort. This isn’t genius…”
“I know I’m not a genius. I hate the so-called ‘talent’ so much. Why is it that without talent, no amount of effort is enough… But today, when you praised me, when you called me a genius, I was still so happy.”
Gu Fuyou clutched at her clothes, crying uncontrollably, “I’m still so happy.”
Gu Fuyou rubbed her eyes with one hand, her eyes already red and swollen. Zhong Michu took her hand away and said, “Gu Fuyou, don’t rub like that. You’ll hurt your eyes.”
Zhong Michu raised her own white sleeve and gently pressed it under Gu Fuyou’s eyes, absorbing the tears.
Gu Fuyou pinched Zhong Michu’s hanging sleeve and sobbed, “They all look down on me.”
Zhong Michu said, “You’re incredible.”
On hearing this, Gu Fuyou tried to suppress her tears, but they fell even harder.
Zhong Michu remained silent, offering her comfort.
Chapter 27
The Dragon Egg and the Two Maidens’ Perilous Adventure
The more Gu Fuyou grew up, the less she cried, except in front of her father, where she would get emotional like a child. In front of others, the more upset she was, the less she was willing to shed tears.
Yet, in Zhong Michu’s presence, an unforeseen tide of sorrow breached her defenses, causing her to cry unrestrainedly.
She cried throughout the night and finally fell into a restless sleep near dawn, only remembering that she had soaked Zhong Michu’s sleeve with her tears.
When she got up the next day, the sun was high in the sky, and it was already midday.
Gu Fuyou felt much calmer, as if all the long-accumulated mess in her heart had been swept away. She felt relaxed and clear-headed.
Although she felt embarrassed thinking back on her state the previous day, she thought, she had already lost face in front of Zhong Michu more than once or twice, so there was no good image to uphold.
Moreover, she was eager to see her, pushing any lingering embarrassment to the back of her mind.
Gu Fuyou, with her hands clasped behind her back and a spring in her step, walked up to Zhong Michu’s door and knocked.
“The door is not locked.”
Gu Fuyou pushed the door open, stood at the doorway with half her body leaning in, a bright smile on her face, and lightly called, “Senior sister~”
The truth was, Gu Fuyou didn’t have any particular business with Zhong Michu; she simply wanted to see her.
She felt very happy when she woke up, as if something good was waiting for her. But when she thought about it carefully, there was no good news, just that she could see Zhong Michu right away.
“Come in.”
Gu Fuyou entered the room. Zhong Michu was meditating on her bed. Seeing Gu Fuyou approach, she stopped and got up.
Reflecting on the battle with Yu Dongsheng the previous day, even though they emerged victorious through strategy, it was no doubt a tough fight.
Of course, it was a hard fight for Gu Fuyou. Because her injuries had not fully healed, the two agreed to rest for two days before going to the market.
Gu Fuyou walked to the bed and saw a brocade box lying on the wooden cabinet beside it. The lid of the box was open, and the moss-covered stone they had won yesterday was lying inside.
She picked up the stone, examined it carefully, and asked, “Senior Sister Zhong, you said there’s something inside this stone worth a million spirit stones. What exactly is inside?”
Zhong Michu looked at her in surprise, seemingly amazed that she had recovered overnight, as if the person who cried messily last night wasn’t her.
After a long pause, Zhong Michu said, “It’s a Golden Dragon’s egg.”
“What?!” Gu Fuyou almost dropped the stone in shock.
She tapped the stone with her finger and sent a trace of her spirit into it but couldn’t make anything out.
Although she couldn’t believe that this dark stone in her hand was a dragon egg, she thought that Zhong Michu, with her deep knowledge of beast taming and some study of the dragon clan, must have seen something special about this stone. And Zhong Michu wouldn’t lie to her about this.
Caught between surging excitement and the cautious fear of being overly hopeful, Gu Fuyou whispered, “Is it truly a Dragon egg?”
If it was, it was worth far more than a million spirit stones; it was a priceless treasure!
There were records of the dragon clan in the “Records of the Azure Emperor,” but she couldn’t remember the details. She only remembered that dragon horns, scales, tendons, blood, flesh, and bones were all excellent for crafting, pill refining, or cultivation. In short, every part of a dragon was a treasure.
Seeing Zhong Michu nod, Gu Fuyou nearly shrieked with joy.
There are three branches of the Azure Phoenix clan. Among the Dragons, there are two main branches: the Five-clawed Divine Dragon and the Nine-clawed Golden Dragon.
These two mystical beast clans were worshipped as deities by mortals in ancient times and held immense power.
However, tens of thousands of years ago, a conflict arose between the two clans, eventually escalating into war.
In the final battle, almost all members of the Azure Phoenix clan were wiped out, reportedly leaving only three survivors, while the Golden Dragon clan suffered heavy losses, with no members of the royal bloodline surviving
This war greatly weakened both clans, significantly reducing their power and giving rise to the human immortal sects. This was one of the main reasons why the human sects could gradually take control over the other four continents from the Azure Phoenix clan.
Despite their losses, both clans remained dominant forces due to their sheer power and the deep-seated reverence and fear they inspired in humans. Even the Four Immortal Sects were reluctant to provoke the Azure Phoenix and Dragon clans.
This was also why, despite the immense value of their bodies, no one dared to hunt them. Dragon scales and Phoenix feathers were extremely rare and invaluable, only obtained as gifts from the clans themselves or traded by the clans.
Gu Fuyou’s eyes sparkled with anticipation, “Senior Sister, do you have a way to hatch it?”
Zhong Michu shook her head. “The young dragon inside is dormant, having slept too long and missed the hatching period. Waking it up is not easy, and hatching it is impossible.”
“The young dragon inside is in hibernation, having slept for far too long and missing its hatching window. Waking it is difficult; hatching it is impossible.”
Gu Fuyou’s face fell in disappointment, “Ah? So it’s basically a dead egg?”
Even though the dragon egg, even as a dead egg, was still priceless, it was useless to them.
They couldn’t use it for crafting, nor could they risk damaging it.
The Dragon clan was fiercely protective. Especially now, with the Golden Dragons in decline, if they discovered someone had obtained a Golden Dragon egg and damaged it, there was no telling if they’d tear that person limb from limb or grind them to dust.
If the Golden Dragon egg were still alive and could be hatched, things would be different.
She and Zhong Michu could raise the little golden dragon together, maybe sneakily pluck a bit of dragon whisker or something. Even if it has to return to the Four Seas in the end, she and Zhong Michu have put in their hard work if not meritorious deeds. Presumably, the Dragon clan won’t just reward them with some dragon scales but also some rare treasures from the sea.
Alas, what a pity.
It looked like a treasure, but in reality, it was of little practical use.
Gu Fuyou touched the dragon egg, suddenly feeling a prick of pain in her hand. The pain made her hiss, and she drew back her hand as if she had been electrocuted.
“What happened?”
Gu Fuyou was also surprised, turned the dragon egg around, and it turned out that the circle of rough stone wrapped around the dragon egg was not smooth.
The place Gu Fuyou touched had a gap, and the edge of the stone at the gap was very sharp, like a sword’s edge. As Gu Fuyou touched it, she cut her finger, and fresh blood flowed from the fingertip, dropping into the gap and seeping in.
It looked as if it had been bitten.
She was disappointed and even got hurt.
Gu Fuyou pinched her injured finger, threw the dragon egg back into the box, and muttered, “It’s really like the dragon clan, still so fierce even in hibernation.”
Zhong Michu, who was arranging the brocade box, turned and asked, “Are Dragons that fierce?”
Gu Fuyou showed her the cut, “Isn’t this proof?”
Zhong Michu: “…”
Gu Fuyou’s disappointment didn’t last long, and she cheered up again.
After all, this dragon egg indirectly helped her earn ten million spirit stones. Besides, the dragon egg originally belonged to Zhong Michu, so it was up to Zhong Michu to decide what to do with it. She might as well pretend she didn’t know it was a dragon egg.
With that thought, she put the matter behind her.
After resting for a day, the two went on shopping for several days. With plenty of money to spend, Gu Fuyou wanted to buy everything she saw.
Considering Zhong Michu found a dragon egg on the first day, Gu Fuyou not only believed in her discernment but also thought she was extremely lucky. She dragged her back to the raw stone stalls.
As Gu Fuyou expected, Zhong Michu had an impeccable knack for making choices.
Although they were not extremely rare and precious items, they could be sold for tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of spirit stones.
They discovered two spiritual artifacts. One was a Thunderstone, a thunder-attributed spiritual treasure. After absorbing it, one could not only improve their cultivation but also refine the power of thunder, summoning thunder with a booming sound that could shake the heavens and shatter enemies, perfectly suitable for those with a thunder spiritual root. The other was a core of a Nascent Soul Stage spirit beast, a very pure Fire Spirit Pill.
When these artifacts were revealed, not only did the stall owner offer to buy them back, but passing cultivators also made high bids.
Gu Fuyou refused to sell.
She’s not short of money now.
Of the two spiritual treasures, she fed one to Ah Fu, and planned to keep the other for Si Miao.
Gu Fuyou, with Zhong Michu by her side, spent days around the raw stone stalls. Both Gu Fuyou and the stall owners were driven mad — she was mad with joy at Zhong Michu’s treasure-finding ability, while the stall owners were horrified, opting to flee at the sight of the duo.
They played at the market for several days until the time of the canyon race.
This time, the race was held in the Yunduan Grand Canyon outside the East City, starting at Moon Exit Pass.
The two, along with Ah Fu, headed to Moon Exit Pass, the uniqueness of its geography evident right from the entrance.
The entrance to the Moon Exit Pass was a pavilion, situated on the cliffs on both sides, connecting the two ends, with a hollow valley underneath.
There were guards in front of the pavilion, and inside was a table where a guide sat, ready to answer any race-related questions for the visitors.
Gu Fuyou glanced at him and asked curiously, “Weren’t these usually handled by Mr. Qu in previous years?”
The guide, a man in blue robes with a long beard, replied, “Mr. Qu is ill, so I’m filling in for him.”
Gu Fuyou didn’t think much of it and handed over their entry tokens. The man in blue took them, checked them, and then asked, “What do you want to know?”
“The rules for this year’s race?”
“The same as previous years.”
“Is it a ground race or an air race?”
“Ground.”
Gu Fuyou gave him a few hundred spirit stones, saying, “Thank you.”
The man smiled slightly, “Safe travels to you both.”
The two of them, along with their beast, passed through the entrance to the Moon Exit Pass.
The Yunduan Grand Canyon stretched for thousands of miles, like a sword from beyond the skies had slashed the earth in half. Viewing the canyon from midair on a flying sword, the scene was extraordinarily majestic.
The Moon Exit Pass was located in the middle section of the Yunduan Grand Canyon, with peculiar peaks towering on both sides, shrouded in mist, reaching straight into the clouds.
The race wouldn’t start until the next day, so the two found an inn to stay for the night.
This inn was unique, built into the cliffside, carved out of the mountain to create individual stone rooms.
Climbing up the narrow, man-made mountain path, they could vaguely see lights below. This side of the mountain had many ‘rooms’ up and down.
The young guide led the two into one of these rooms. While it was spacious, the interior – with its stone bed, stone table, and stone stools – felt cold and hard.
The young man said with pride “Guests, this is the best room in our inn.”
“The best?” Gu Fuyou questioned with a hint of skepticism.
With a grand gesture towards the outside, the boy elaborated, “Of course, this is our inn’s best room with a mountain view. The view is excellent. To the left, you can see the treacherous winding dragon path of the Yunduan Grand Canyon, and to the right, the lush green summer scenery of Cuiyun Peak. In the distance…”
The room featured a large, square entrance that did not obstruct the view. However, a barrier had been set up so that while those inside could see out, those outside couldn’t peek in.
“Okay, okay, I get it.” Gu Fuyou handed over some spirit stones as payment and dismissed the boy.
Gu Fuyou sat on the stone bed and took out a bag of spirit stones to feed Ah Fu as a snack.
Ah Fu crunched noisily. Gu Fuyou pinched the flesh on its cheek and said, “Ah Fu, the race is on you tomorrow. I don’t expect you to finish first, but don’t end up last either.”
Ah Fu responded with a “woof” of understanding.
Gu Fuyou felt both proud and jealous. Ah Fu’s cultivation was growing rapidly, having already reached the peak of Qi Practicing, catching up to her.
Moreover, Ah Fu had grown bigger, strong as a bull.
Gu Fuyou added, “Luckily it’s a ground race. You can carry me. If it were flying, with your cultivation, you wouldn’t be able to soar. I’d have to trouble myself finding another spirit beast.”
Turning to Zhong Michu, while hugging Ah Fu and rubbing her face against its fluffy chest, Gu Fuyou inquired, “Senior Sister Zhong, are you participating in tomorrow’s race? I’ve never seen your spirit beast.”
Zhong Michu stood by the rocky wall, seemingly admiring the mountain view. The mountain breeze caused her dress to flutter and her hair to dance in the wind.
Seeing this, Gu Fuyou smiled, realizing Zhong Michu must have fallen in love with the place.
In Yunduan Grand Canyon, one could best feel the vastness of the world.
Zhong Michu finally responded, “I don’t have a spirit beast.”
Surprised, Gu Fuyou asked, “Have you not summoned it yet?”
Zhong Michu shook her head, saying, “I can’t summon.”
Gu Fuyou assumed she meant she’d tried and failed. Indeed, there were cases where, despite one’s abilities, they received no response during the summoning ritual. Such individuals were not uncommon.
Silently, Gu Fuyou reflected, “So, Senior Sister Zhong also has her limitations.”
Chapter 28
Words Can Wound Deeper Than Spears
After a night’s rest, the two woke to unfavorable weather. The day was overcast, with thick clouds blocking the sun. The wind blew strongly in the canyon, and even though it was summer, it felt chilly.
Gu Fuyou sat on Ah Fu, testing its strength, while Zhong Michu walked beside Ah Fu. Along the way, they encountered various cultivators, each accompanied by their spirit beasts.
Throughout the journey, Gu Fuyou was very excited. However, when she thought of Zhong Michu not being able to join her in the race, she felt a tinge of regret, thinking it was not perfect.
“Senior Sister Zhong,” she said, “you should have told me earlier that you can’t summon a spirit beast. We could have bought one in the market for you to ride temporarily. Then we could have raced together.”
Zhong Michu didn’t respond. Gu Fuyou, used to her silences, continued, “Next time. The next time we visit the Wandering Market, I’ll bring you along, and we can race together.”
Gu Fuyou leaned closer to her, feeling she had come up with a great idea, and said excitedly, “Senior Sister Zhong, next time let’s visit the roaming market together, alright?”
“Sit tight,” Zhong Michu advised, turning her head so they were mere inches apart.
The mountain winds had turned Zhong Michu’s cheeks pale, but her skin, being of a special spiritual nature, remained moist despite the constant cold, making it seem even more like jade.
For some reason, Gu Fuyou felt her face heat up and awkwardly straightened up.
Zhong Michu wasn’t actually looking at Gu Fuyou’s face; her gaze was fixed behind her. She called out, “Gu Fuyou.”
“Huh?!” Taken aback, Gu Fuyou reflexively clutched Ah Fu’s fur, causing the creature to let out a low growl of protest.
“Why do most of them have flying beasts, if this is a land race?” Zhong Michu pointed out.
Gu Fuyou paused, and upon Zhong Michu’s observation, noticed the same. While spirit beasts with high cultivation can fly and run on land, they’re still most powerful in their natural environment.
In other words, while it’s possible to use a flying creature in a land race, it isn’t ideal.
A sinking feeling rose in Gu Fuyou’s heart.
She quickly moved Ah Fu to the starting point, with Zhong Michu following on her sword.
Upon reaching the start, Gu Fuyou’s heart sank. Every participant had brought a flying spirit beast.
When Gu Fuyou questioned an official from the merchants’ association, he confirmed, “It’s an aerial race.”
Frowning deeply, Gu Fuyou challenged, “Why is it an aerial race? Wasn’t it supposed to be on land?”
“Perhaps you misunderstood?” he mused.
Frustrated but laughing in disbelief, Gu Fuyou retorted, “I asked the guide directly. He clearly said it was a ground race!”
The official chuckled, “Considering all the participants have brought flying beasts, isn’t it unlikely that everyone else got it wrong? We have no reason to deceive you.”
Irritated, Gu Fuyou left. Seeing her distressed expression, Zhong Michu inquired, “What happened?”
Pulling a face, Gu Fuyou sighed, “Turns out, it’s an aerial race. Ah Fu won’t be of any use this time.”
Ah Fu had only reached the peak of Qi Practicing and couldn’t fly.
Gu Fuyou looked at Ah Fu, who tilted his head slightly and stared back with his lustrous black eyes, appearing quite clueless.
She realized the only suspicious person in this situation was the guide. But she couldn’t leave, as her entry token could only be used once.
Even if she could leave, finding another spirit beast was not an option now.
Competitors kept arriving, and as soon as everyone was present, the race would start.
Gu Fuyou lunged and buried her face in Ah Fu’s fur, muffling her exasperated hums into its chest.
Even with all her capabilities, without a spirit beast, she felt helpless now.
Though missing the race wouldn’t physically harm her, she had been looking forward to this. Her hopes dashed by external factors made her frustrated.
Moreover, this was her first time entering without relying on her brother’s power, and she felt a bit proud deep down.
She wanted to go further, climb higher, and push her limits.
Somehow, she believed she could do it.
Even if she didn’t win, she hoped to at least rank in the race. Now that everything was shattered, how could she not be upset?
Ah Fu, understanding nothing, simply responded to her grumbles with soft whimpers.
“Oh, isn’t this Third Gu?”
Recognizing the voice, Gu Fuyou turned around and immediately frowned in distaste, “Zuo Tianlang.”
Meeting an annoying person when already agitated made her even more frustrated.
Zuo Tianlang strolled over, with a hearty laugh he opened his folding fan, swaying it lightly. With his narrow eyes, he looked up and down frivolously and said, “You’re here for the race too, so why did you bring a land spirit beast?”
Gu Fuyou snapped, “None of your business!”
Zuo Tianlang was about to mock her when his gaze inadvertently landed on Zhong Michu.
She stood elegantly, her dress as white as snow. Her enchanting beauty paired with her indifferent eyes, reminiscent of a sacred lotus on a mountaintop, unreachable.
People experienced in romance and sophistication know that there’s a unique charm when a dignified woman shows a hint of vulnerability.
As Zuo Tianlang looked at Zhong Michu, his eyes narrowed, and his pupils deepened.
He wondered how this woman, with her rosy cheeks and alluring presence, would look in a passionately enticing moment.
Gu Fuyou might not know the dirty thoughts running through his mind, but judging by his look, she was sure they weren’t good.
Gu Fuyou shifted to the side, positioning herself directly in front of Zhong Michu, lining up with her.
With a stern face, Gu Fuyou crossed her arms and called out, “Ah Fu, come here.”
Ah Fu walked over and sat down beside Gu Fuyou, effectively blocking Zuo Tianlang’s view.
Zuo Tianlang playfully shook his fan a few times, smiled, and remarked, “It seems that Gu Ren really didn’t show up.”
“I even specially arranged for someone to greet you.”
A thought crossed Gu Fuyou’s mind, and she responded, “So the guide was arranged by you!”
Speaking of land, when it’s actually in the air.
Her brother’s spirit beast is a black panther, also a land beast. If it had come and fallen into Zuo Tianlang’s trap, even though the beast could fly, its strength would be greatly diminished in the air, playing right into Zuo Tianlang’s hands.
Closing his fan with a snap, Zuo Tianlang tapped his head with it and lamented, “Ah, what a waste of effort. If I had known it was just a minor player like you, why would I have bothered?”
Gu Fuyou retorted, “You can’t defeat my brother, so you resort to these underhanded tricks.”
Zuo Tianlang said, “Strategy is also a talent. Like now, with a snap of my fingers, I can make you forfeit the race.”
Gu Fuyou defiantly responded, “Who says I can’t compete?”
She grabbed Ah Fu’s ear, giving it a tug and declaring, “If worst comes to worst, I’ll have my spirit beast run in the air; let’s see how you feel when all your meticulous planning falls apart. Master Zuo, watch closely: my Ah Fu runs incredibly fast, like lightning, and it’d be quite embarrassing if you, atop your flying beast, were to lose to him.”
Ah Fu cooperated with a loud howl, looking imposing.
Zuo Tianlang sneered, “Very well, I’m eager to see this lightning-fast spirit beast of yours.”
After that, he walked away with his entourage.
Once Zuo Tianlang was out of sight, Zhong Michu inquired, “Can Ah Fu fly?”
Gu Fuyou, her cheeks slightly red, replied, “I was just standing up to him. With him being so arrogant, shouldn’t I at least get a verbal victory?”
After her explanation, she suddenly realized that Zhong Michu was teasing her earlier.
It was a surprising revelation. This was the first time Gu Fuyou saw Zhong Michu make a joke, and it was so unexpected that it made her forget her earlier displeasure.
Switching her gloomy expression, she motioned to Ah Fu and prepared to leave, saying, “Senior Sister Zhong, let’s go.”
Zhong Michu asked, “Aren’t you participating in the race?”
Embarrassed, Gu Fuyou mumbled, “I was just bluffing…”
She wanted to flee after the bluff. For one, she didn’t want to deal with Zuo Tianlang, who was always looking for trouble. Secondly, considering how Zuo Tianlang looked at Zhong Michu, she hoped Zhong Michu could also stay away from him.
Zhong Michu glanced at the thick fog and dense clouds in the sky, and when she lowered her head, she asked, “Gu Fuyou, do you want to join the race?”
Feeling a bit dejected, Gu Fuyou gently patted Ah Fu’s head, admitting, “I do, but Ah Fu can’t fly.”
Zhong Michu remained silent for a moment, as if contemplating something. After a while, she spoke softly, “I’ll think of a way for you. Just wait.”
“Huh?”
Gu Fuyou thought to herself, “What solution could there be? You can’t summon either.”
She was about to call out, “Senior Sister Zhong…”
But Zhong Michu had already soared away on her sword, following the path they had come from. Gu Fuyou stood in place for a moment, then suddenly had a thought, murmuring to herself, “Ah! Senior Sister Zhong is skilled in beast taming. Maybe she can get a flying spirit beast from somewhere!”
The more he thought about it, the more it made sense.
At that moment, the bell signaling the gathering of participants at the starting line rang.
Gu Fuyou hesitated for a moment, took a deep breath, and decided to head towards the starting point.
The starting point was on the arch bridge of Wangyue Cave. A massive rock connected both ends of the canyon, forming a natural stone bridge.
By the time Gu Fuyou arrived, all the participants were ready on the stone bridge, proudly sitting atop their spirit beasts. These flying beasts were either ferocious, majestic, or dazzling, poised for action on the bridge.
The official in charge asked, “Third Miss, where is your spirit beast?”
Gu Fuyou replied, “Uh… it’ll be here in a bit.”
“This… Very well.”
The official allowed her onto the stone bridge. While everyone else proudly sat atop their spirit beasts, she alone walked onto the bridge on foot.
She had intended to stand off to the side and avoid attention. Unexpectedly, she accidentally stepped on a wing feather of a nearby beast. The beast roared, and she kept moving to avoid it, somehow getting pushed more into the center.
Laughter from those seated atop their beasts reached her ears, “Isn’t that Third Miss? Why is she here for the race?”
“Where’s her spirit beast?”
“They say she’s a bit off in the head, reckless. Is she planning to run on her own two feet against us? Haha.”
Eventually, Gu Fuyou found a clear spot in the middle and stopped.
She overheard someone ask, “Who is the Third Miss?”
“Oh, that’s Third Gu from Xiaoyao City, Gu Wanpeng’s daughter.”
“Oh, her, I know, I know.”
Gu Fuyou tightened her clothes, feeling a strong wind on the bridge that made her head spin.
“I heard she’s the reason Lady Gu died in childbirth.”
Gu Fuyou frowned, thinking how these men had longer tongues than the gossiping old ladies back home.
“Yes, that’s her. Lady Gu was such a beauty and highly skilled. It’s a shame she died giving birth to a daughter with average talent. Gu Wanpeng lost both his wife and got a mediocre daughter.”
Another man chuckled, “If someone who caused her own mother’s death had any talent, then there’s no justice in this world.”
Gu Fuyou’s face turned pale, her heart ached, causing her forehead to be covered in cold sweat and her breathing to become labored.
Without thinking, she turned around and called out weakly, “Brother…”
But there was no one behind her. It then dawned on her that Gu Shuangqing hadn’t come, and there wouldn’t be anyone to hold and comfort her as usual, covering her ears to block out the hurtful words.
Those words echoed clearly in her ears. She wanted to retort, but when she opened her mouth, no sound came out.
Chapter 29
In the Path to Immortality, I Soar to the Heavens
Endless darkness surged behind her, enveloping her in its embrace. Around her, people stood, pointing at her, their faces twisted into mocking expressions.
Pain gripped Gu Fuyou’s heart, leading to nausea and an emotional urge to vomit.
Just then, the laughter ceased abruptly. Someone shouted, “What is that?!”
A moist, cold aura approached, and Gu Fuyou found it oddly familiar. This elusive mist evoked a sense of comfort and reliability.
Chaos ensued. Gu Fuyou turned towards the source of the cold, and saw a cloud of mist rolling in. Something seemed to be moving within the mist.
She caught her breath, captivated by the sight, unable to look away.
Ancient texts say, “When the gods created the world and chaos first began, the Dragon bore the sun and moon, and the Azure Phoenix carried the stars.”
Their majesty, deeply rooted in people’s hearts since the birth of humanity.
Later generations spoke of two mythical creatures: one from the scale clan, the other from the feathered clan.
There are many scaled and feathered creatures in the universe, but everyone knows this refers specifically to the Dragon and Azure Phoenix clans.
The Azure Phoenix, with its profound beauty, looks down upon all life forms. It is the eternal bird of the nine heavens, forever representing nobility and splendor.
As for the Dragon, its beauty embodies humanity’s ultimate desire for power.
Its body spans a thousand miles, with springs that are nine-fold deep. When it raises its whiskers, clouds form, and it moves along with the waves.
Eclipsing the sun, soaring the sky, riding the waves, dominating the oceans.
Deep down, humans always revered and worshipped these two clans. Just like now, when Gu Fuyou glimpsed the figure in the mist, even though it was just a fraction, she was instantly captivated.
“Is that… Am I seeing things?”
“Brother, that looks like a divine Dragon to me. I didn’t hear any news of a Dragon coming to the market.”
“It’s coming this way.”
“Why isn’t anyone from the merchant association explaining?”
“Is it here for the race?”
“This has to be a joke. It’s probably just passing by.”
As it approached closer, Gu Fuyou’s absurd premonition grew stronger. Her heart felt like it would burst from her chest.
She murmured deliriously, “I must be going mad, I’m losing it, I’ve definitely lost it…”
With a collective gasp from the crowd, Gu Fuyou’s heartbeat reached its peak. The spirit beasts on either side scattered, leaving a vast open space around her.
The divine Dragon coiled its body and settled down in front of Gu Fuyou.
Gu Fuyou locked eyes with its golden beastly pupils, getting a clear view of its magnificent form.
A white five-clawed divine Dragon. Compared to the vast mature Dragon, this White Dragon seemed petite, but it was still majestic compared to the creatures beside it.
Its Dragon whiskers and the mane on its spine and behind its claws didn’t resemble tangible hair. Instead, it looked like soft, snowy fluff, almost cloud-like, swaying gently with the breeze.
Gu Fuyou covered her mouth, her eyes filled with tears, but she dared not make a sound, fearing to break the dream.
As the White Dragon approached, she instinctively backed away but found herself on the edge of a stone bridge, losing her footing and falling backward.
For a moment, she felt weightless, then felt something tighten around her waist.
The Dragon’s tail wrapped around her, placing her securely on its back.
Sitting atop the Dragon’s spine, Gu Fuyou felt torn.
Half of her couldn’t believe the reality before her – sitting atop a divine Dragon that seemed to have come to accompany her in a race. The other half trembled with anxiety, mumbling in a shaky voice, “Oh no, I’m going to die, I’m going to die…”
She felt like crying, her tears a mix of excitement, grievance, pride, and fear.
Whispers filled the surroundings, with everyone present visibly shocked.
A divine Dragon had chosen to carry a human.
The proud Azure Phoenix and Dragon only ever allowed their mates and family to ride them.
To think that a Dragon would carry a human, especially one only at the peak of Qi Practicing, was unfathomable. Claiming that Gu Fuyou was family to this Dragon was improbable. Suggesting she was its partner was even more inconceivable.
An official rushed in, cautiously approaching the White Dragon. He hesitated, took a couple of steps back, and bowed, calling out, “Third Miss, Third Miss.”
His voice was soft and restrained. After several calls, Gu Fuyou snapped back to reality.
“Third Miss, who is…?”
Gu Fuyou replied, “Ah, it… it…”
She was at a loss for words, finally whispering, “It might be here to race with me.”
“Is that…?”
“It’s not against the rules.”
The White Dragon cast a sideways glance at the official, who wiped the sweat from his forehead and responded, “It’s not against the rules, not against the rules.”
“Since Third Miss… erm… companion has arrived, let’s start the race.”
“Okay.”
Before the official had left, a sneer sounded from the left. Zuo Tianlang stood on the back of a three-headed red pigeon, one foot on the pigeon’s head, loudly saying to Gu Fuyou’s side, “What kind of divine Dragon? Gu Fuyou is just bluffing. She even managed to deceive you. Which divine Dragon in the world doesn’t have dragon horns? Look at that creature. Does it have Dragon horns? Maybe it’s just a reptile from somewhere pretending to be a divine Dragon.”
In fact, from beginning to end, Gu Fuyou and the White Dragon never claimed to be a divine Dragon. Those were just whispers and speculations from bystanders.
People had noticed the absence of horns on the White Dragon but were too awed by its entrance and naturally reverent of Dragons to voice their doubts openly.
However, Gu Fuyou was certain. This truly was a five-clawed divine Dragon.
It did have horns, but they had been broken.
Sitting on its back, Gu Fuyou could see clearly. The horn was broken right from the base, seemingly injured by a sharp weapon. The horn was regrowing, with a new little horn emerging, much softer in color than the base.
Gu Fuyou thought, “That must have hurt so much.”
She couldn’t help but reach out to touch it. The moment her hand touched the broken horn, the White Dragon reacted violently, jerking its body and throwing Gu Fuyou off.
Gu Fuyou fell to the ground, hurting her hips. The White Dragon approached, emitting a deep rumble.
Gu Fuyou propped herself up on her hands and leaned slightly back, saying, “I’m sorry, I…”
The official signaled the start with a chime. The White Dragon again wrapped its tail around her waist, but this time keeping her far from its head, and placed her in the middle of its back.
As the golden bell rang, everyone readied themselves, preparing to urge their spiritual beasts into a dive.
Suddenly, the White Dragon raised its head and let out a majestic roar.
The sound of its roar reverberated throughout the skies.
All the other spirit beasts stopped, not daring to go ahead. Some of the lower-ranked beasts even collapsed to the ground.
The White Dragon, carrying Gu Fuyou, leaped out. Looking back, Gu Fuyou saw people on the bridge pulling and shouting at their spirit beasts to move. Only a few high-level ones slowly took to the air.
Gu Fuyou wondered if this could be considered cheating.
Then again, using a divine Dragon in a race already seemed like an unfair advantage.
Gu Fuyou bent down, hugging the White Dragon. Biting her lower lip, she couldn’t help but smile. She buried her face in the soft, snowy mane of the Dragon, which felt as soft as it looked.
She felt an indescribable sense of peace and satisfaction.
In the Yunduan Grand Canyon, there are three major obstacles that participants must navigate during aerial races. First is the Panlong Road, a winding path; second, the Duantian Waterfall, which drops three thousand feet; and third, the Yixian Sky, a narrow path sandwiched between two strange rocks.
Until they reach the Yixian, there are defensive formations above the canyon. Spirit beasts cannot fly out of the canyon or breach these formations until they’ve passed the Yixian Sky, only then can they freely soar.
The White Dragon takes the lead, reaching the Panlong Road first. The Panlong Road is winding, with sharp stones below, jagged like dog’s teeth. Even dragons have to be careful when traversing this path, hence the name ‘Panlong Road’, which means Coiling Dragon Road.
As the White Dragon entered the stone forest, it slowed down. Suddenly, a burst of purple fire came from behind. The White Dragon swiftly maneuvered around a stone pillar to avoid it. The purple fire narrowly grazed Gu Fuyou.
She could feel its scorching heat.
Looking back, Gu Fuyou saw that Zuo Tianlang and other cultivators were catching up.
The fireball had been thrown by Zuo Tianlang, and he was still holding another purple flame in his hand.
While there was a rule against spiritual beasts attacking each other in the race, there was no explicit rule against cultivators doing so. Hence, past races always had instances of cultivators sabotaging one another, trying to knock each other off their beasts.
Zuo Tianlang was about to attack again when a man beside him, seemingly his subordinate, grabbed his arm, warning, “Young Master, if that really is a Dragon, injuring it might incur the wrath of the Dragons from the four seas.”
Zuo Tianlang brushed off the man’s hand, retorting, “What Dragon clan? Would a Dragon carry Gu Fuyou? Would a Dragon be without horns? It’s just a reptile!”
The man cautioned, “Young Master, it’s better to be safe than sorry. If our sect leader finds out you’ve provoked it, you might get punished.”
“Get lost! I won’t let her get ahead of me today. If there is any punishment, I’ll bear it alone.” Zuo Tianlang retorted.
He then announced to his followers, “Today, anyone who hits that reptile or Gu Fuyou will be rewarded 50,000 spirit stones for a hit, and if they make her fall, a reward of a million spirit stones and a promotion to an inner disciple of the Xu Ling Sect.”
As the saying goes, a generous reward brings out the brave.
Soon, elements like wind, fire, water, and thunder were hurled from behind.
The White Dragon skillfully dodged each attack as if it had eyes on its back.
However, the attackers grew bolder after their initial assaults. Earlier, they were somewhat restrained, but now they attacked more ferociously and frequently.
Navigating through the maze-like Stone Forest, it was impossible for the White Dragon to dodge everything. It was hit by a bolt of thunder, but its scales, being among the strongest in the world, protected it. Yet, a patch of the Dragon’s pristine white mane near Gu Fuyou was singed black.
Gu Fuyou’s eyes widened in shock, her hands clutching the charred mane. In frustration, she cried out, “Aaahhhhh!!”
She looked back with fierce eyes and shouted, “Scoundrels!”
Rummaging through her storage bag, she angrily threw out the magical tools she had bought and the talismans she had made, exclaiming, “Think you’re the only ones who can throw fire? Taste this!”
She detonated one of the talismans, and the items exploded in a chain. Many of the magical items were crafted by Golden Core and Nascent Soul cultivators and were of high quality. Their combined explosion was incredibly powerful.
A huge fire erupted within the stone forest, turning the area behind the White Dragon into a sea of flames.
The White Dragon had already darted out of the Panlong Road, but Zuo Tianlang, riding a three-legged red sparrow, burst through the flames and followed closely, with two Golden Core cultivators guarding him.
In his rage, Zuo Tianlang ordered the two to take down Gu Fuyou at all costs.
Although they were wary of the White Dragon’s identity and didn’t dare to attack it directly, they didn’t hold back against Gu Fuyou, hurling all sorts of spells at her. Gu Fuyou, being a Qi Practicing, would be gravely injured if she were hit even slightly.
The White Dragon suddenly sped up, heading towards the Duantian Waterfall. The Duantian Waterfall’s water flows rapidly, looking like a white ribbon hanging from the mountain, its waves exploding into a white mist at the bottom.”
A transparent wind ball pressed down on Gu Fuyou’s back. It felt like a huge boulder was crushing her, getting closer, threatening to squash her into pulp.
Just then, the White Dragon dove downwards, flying parallel to the waterfall and plunging into the water. The gust dispersed upon the water’s surface.
The cultivators beside Zuo Tianlang seemingly lacked water attributes, or perhaps were not adept in it. They couldn’t handle the White Dragon and Gu Fuyou underwater.
Underwater, Gu Fuyou clung to the White Dragon, her head encased in a bubble that allowed her to breathe. The White Dragon moved even faster in water than in air. It swam rapidly, eventually emerging at the entrance of Yixian Sky.
On either side of the Yixian Sky were towering cliffs with uniquely shaped rocks jutting out. Because the passage was extremely narrow, flying too fast could easily result in a collision.
Just as the White Dragon entered the Yixian, Gu Fuyou heard Zuo Tianlang shout, “Knock them down!”
Gu Fuyou glanced back and saw Zuo Tianlang and his two companions following from a distance, their persistence unwavering.
The two Golden Core cultivators started to channel their spiritual energy. Gu Fuyou thought they were about to attack her again, but then she noticed their hands slightly shifting their direction.
Alarmed, Gu Fuyou quickly warned the White Dragon, “Be careful!”
Their actual targets were the cliff walls. Struck by their force, the prominent rocks shattered. Massive stones began descending like a rainstorm, a sight so overwhelming it left one breathless.
The White Dragon accelerated, navigated through the gaps of the falling rocks, carrying Gu Fuyou.
The thunderous noise of crashing stones filled Gu Fuyou’s ears, and the fierce wind from narrowly missed boulders grazed her cheeks.
She felt the terror of a near-death experience but was also filled with fearless determination. Her blood was boiling, making her eyes redden, her heart race, and her limbs tremble.
Facing such peril, a person as insignificant as her surprisingly mustered the courage to challenge the heavens and earth, thinking, “If not me, then who?”
She murmured, “Faster, even faster.”
The White Dragon sped up, flying higher. Once they cleared the Yixian Sky, the vast sky would be theirs to explore.
The White Dragon, swift as lightning and resembling a white cloud, dodged the falling rocks and finally passed the perilous path. Yet, it didn’t slow down and continued to soar towards the cloudy sky.
Suddenly, dense mists enveloped them, with heavy grey clouds looming.
In her excitement, Gu Fuyou cried out, “Higher, even higher!”
With a dragon’s roar, the White Dragon burst through the clouds, and the view suddenly brightened.
To the west, where the world ends, the fiery red sun was half-concealed, with clouds painted in the most dazzling colors. The magnificent scene before them looked just like a painting.
Gu Fuyou was momentarily spellbound. Her chest heaved due to the lingering heat of the adrenaline rush, and she felt moisture on her face. Touching her face, she realized she was crying.
Who would have thought that someone as insignificant as an ant could soar to the heavens? Such a breathtaking view would probably be etched in her bones, unforgettable for a lifetime.
Chapter 30
Have You Ever Heard a Story?
When the White Dragon reached the finish line carrying Gu Fuyou, there was no sign of anyone else behind them.
Those spectators waiting at the finish line would burst into cheers to greet the victor. This time, however, their voices were filled with astonishment.
The White Dragon landed on the cliff. Nearby, an altar had been set up with an official from the merchants’ association standing by. There was a gentleman writing a document, and upon seeing the first one to arrive, he was left dumbfounded and couldn’t continue writing.
Seated atop the White Dragon, Gu Fuyou tried to catch her breath, her heart still racing.
The onlookers gazed at her with shock and reverence. As Gu Fuyou stepped off the White Dragon and stood by its side, she felt what it’s like to bask in borrowed glory.
It was the official who first regained his composure, announcing loudly, “The winner— Gu Fuyou of Xiaoyao City.”
It was then that the crowd burst into applause, although their cheers were mixed with confusion and uncertainty.
Gu Fuyou couldn’t clearly define her own emotions. In the past, this would have been a moment of glory, something she always desired. She would have been overjoyed, but now, after the adrenaline-filled journey – through stone forests, over raging currents, and soaring into the sky – the sense of accomplishment felt somewhat bland.
Once the gentleman finished writing the document, the official handed it over to Gu Fuyou, saying, “Third Miss, this is the proof of your victory. Later, you can exchange it at the gambling house for your racing prize.”
Before Gu Fuyou could take it, there was another gasp from behind. Turning around, a cold wind hit her face, making her squint.
All she could hear was the sound of something stirring the winds and clouds. Shielding her eyes, she saw the White Dragon taking off towards the direction of the disturbance.
A sinking feeling gripped Gu Fuyou’s heart. She grabbed the document and, without thinking, chased after it.
Running atop the canyon’s high ground, she shouted at the soaring White Dragon, “Wait for me! Wait!”
The surroundings grew dim, with a cold wind blowing.
Knowing she probably couldn’t catch up, she still ran on the cliff’s edge, shouting into the sky, “Why did you help me?”
Chasing halfway, the distance grew. Her legs started to ache and weaken, forcing her to stop. Lips quivering, she whispered, “Why did you come to help me?”
Suddenly, she heard a familiar howl in the distance.
Looking up, she saw a dark figure approaching fast, like a gust of black wind. Embracing it in joy, she exclaimed, “Ah Fu!”
It turned out that Ah Fu had followed them from the canyon’s highlands.
Petting Ah Fu’s head, she said, “I clearly told you to wait at the starting point for your senior sister.”
Ah Fu responded with a series of howls.
Gu Fuyou replied, “I’m not your senior sister, and I don’t understand you. But it’s good you’re here.”
With Ah Fu’s assistance, she mounted its back, instructing, “Ah Fu, chase that cloud ahead…”
Before she could finish, Ah Fu was already in pursuit of the departing White Dragon.
Though still young and at the peak of Qi Practicing, Ah Fu, being a Zhenmao beast, ran like the wind. In terms of speed, it was on par with spirit beasts of the Hollow Void stage.
With the White Dragon soaring in the sky and Ah Fu fervently chasing on the ground, they couldn’t quite catch up but managed to keep it in sight.
Gu Fuyou wondered why this White Dragon happened to appear here, as if specifically to help her.
She had a suspicion, but it seemed so outrageous that she dared not dwell on it.
However, the longer Ah Fu chased, the more familiar the path and scenery became, and her suspicion grew stronger.
Gu Fuyou was breathing rapidly, her voice trembling, “Ah, Ah Fu, let’s take a shortcut. Quick, let’s go this way.”
Gu Fuyou instructed Ah Fu to change their path, heading towards the inn room they had previously booked.
As Ah Fu carried Gu Fuyou along the narrow mountain path, a chilly wind blew. Gu Fuyou looked up to see a cloud of mist entering the very top room at the top of the cliff.
“Ah Fu, hurry.”
Ah Fu, with Gu Fuyou, raced to their room. Gu Fuyou swiftly dismounted from Ah Fu, stumbled a couple of steps, and rushed into the entrance.
In her haste and with her mind racing, she didn’t think much. Entering the dimly lit room, she noticed shadows moving inside.
Her eyes darted to a stack of clothes on the bed. She rolled towards it, quickly grabbing and hugging the clothes to her chest.
The moving figure paused, and silence lingered in the stone chamber for a moment. Gu Fuyou heard her own erratic breathing, cleared her throat, and took two steps into the shadows, saying, “I know it’s you, you’re here.”
A figure slowly emerged from the shadows, revealing itself to be the White Dragon, its body coiled on the wall, lowering its head towards Gu Fuyou.
The White Dragon hummed softly through its nostrils, releasing a cold breath. Having just run against the wind, Gu Fuyou’s hair was already a mess. The cold breath from the dragon caused strands of her hair to droop.
The Dragon’s head moved closer, causing Gu Fuyou to step back until she was against the bed. The Dragon slightly opened its mouth, showing its sharp white fangs.
Gazing into the Dragon’s golden eyes, an innate fear made Gu Fuyou’s legs give out, and she sat on the bed.
Holding onto her white dress, emotions of excitement and fear intertwined, making her tremble, her brain reaching a pinnacle of excitement, almost fainting.
Taking a deep breath, Gu Fuyou cautiously asked, “Are you my senior sister?”
Her voice became more assertive, “You’re Senior Sister Zhong, aren’t you?”
The Dragon’s pupils slightly narrowed, appearing more sharp and imposing.
The Dragon’s body slowly shifted, its mist-like whiskers fluttering. It stared at Gu Fuyou, not answering.
Swallowing hard, Gu Fuyou began, “In Xiaoyao City, there’s a story…”
“Once, there was a fairy in the heavenly palace who descended to the mortal realm. She landed in a peach forest with a serene and elegant scenery. Deep within the forest, there was a clear spring. The fairy took off her feathered robe and left it on the bank, bathing in the spring.”
“A shepherd passed by, and upon hearing the commotion, approached the spring. In his surprise, he took the fairy’s robe, preventing her from returning to the heavens…”
Gu Fuyou glanced at the White Dragon, tugging at the hem of the white dress she was holding, hugging it tighter and leaning back slightly, “If you don’t tell me, I… I won’t return this feathered robe to you.”
The White Dragon observed her for a moment, and with a resigned sigh, spoke, “Gu Fuyou.”
The voice was familiar. Although muddier than Zhong Míchū’s clear voice, Gu Fuyou recognized it.
Her eyes lit up with realization, staring intently at the white Dragon, “Senior Sister Zhong, it’s really you. You are the White Dragon… You are…”
“I…” Tears welled up in Gu Fuyou’s eyes, her voice quivering, “Can I… can I hug you?”
Gu Fuyou stood up and approached the White Dragon. The Dragon, however, retreated and asked, “Aren’t you afraid of me?”
Gu Fuyou persistently asked, “Can I hug you?”
Before the White Dragon could reply, a low hum emitted from its throat. However, Gu Fuyou had already spread her arms wide, pulling the White Dragon into an embrace.
Given the White Dragon’s massive size, Gu Fuyou couldn’t fully wrap her arms around it. Instead, she found herself entirely enveloped in the Dragon’s embrace.
The White Dragon gently lowered its head, resting it atop Gu Fuyou’s. This unexpected hug caught the Dragon off guard, making its majestic visage appear comically stunned as their golden eyes met.
Gu Fuyou tightened her grip and buried her face below the Dragon’s head, holding back tears that began to flow uncontrollably.
The initial summoning ritual wasn’t flawed. She had truly summoned a spirit beast — no, more accurately, she summoned a celestial beast.
She summoned a White Dragon.
Suppressing her emotions, Gu Fuyou asked, “I’m not useless, am I?”
Even though she always displayed pride in front of others, deep down, she was acutely aware of her own abilities. Surrounded by doubt and disdain, her exterior defiance concealed growing self-doubt, sinking so low it bore fruits of inferiority.
She oscillated between self-motivation and self-loathing, uncertain if she would someday give in to despair or achieve her dreams.
Then, Zhong Michu arrived.
The Dragon paused, breathing out a misty sigh. It pulled away slightly, its jaw brushing against Gu Fuyou, as if patting her head, “Gu Fuyou, I told you, you’re amazing, you’re a genius.”
Sniffling, Gu Fuyou wiped the tears from her cheeks. The White Dragon continued, “Can you return my ‘feathered robe’ now?”
Through her tears, Gu Fuyou smiled, “Only if you promise not to fly away suddenly.”
She placed the robe atop the White Dragon’s head, covering its injured horns.
The White Dragon gazed at her, revisiting its previous question, “Gu Fuyou, aren’t you afraid of me?”
Gu Fuyou understood why it asked. Both the Dragon and Azure Phoenix clans possessed unique talents.
The Azure Phoenix clan’s talent was ‘the soul never dies, the body is immortal.’ As long as their spirit wasn’t entirely shattered, they could undergo countless cycles of rebirth.
The innate talent of the Dragon clan is dominance. They are the natural kings, the lords of all spirit beasts. Except for the Azure Phoenix Clan, all spirit beasts naturally submit to them. Even if a spirit beast has greater spiritual power than a dragon, it would still feel affinity towards them and wouldn’t easily harm them.
Thus, Zhong Michu couldn’t summon not because she couldn’t bring forth a spirit beast, but if she did, all the spirit beasts would fawn over her, rushing to please her. She might inadvertently cause a beastly stampede.
This talent gives the Dragon clan an inviolable majesty. Even peers, when standing before a dragon, feel a sense of fear deep within. Especially considering Gu Fuyou is only a Qi-practitioner.
This fear is something Gu Fuyou knows deeply. When Zhong Michu was in her human form, this feeling was faint, and only sensitive spirit beasts could sense it. But once she transformed into her dragon form, this sensation surged intensely, permeating every pore.
Gu Fuyou said, “I’m not afraid.”
Zhong Michu’s eyes slightly narrowed. When she transformed into a Dragon, she wasn’t used to it; many instincts were hard to control. She didn’t think she appeared very friendly: “Why?”
Gu Fuyou repeated, “Why?”
“Because you’re my senior sister,” Gu Fuyou replied, scratching her cheek. Even though she was speaking honestly, she appeared a bit shy, possibly embarrassed about her initial frivolous behavior. “At first, when I met you in Xuan Miao Sect, I might have been a little afraid, but later on, I realized, I knew…”
Knew what?
There isn’t a softer person in the world than you.
The White Dragon whispered, “The first time you saw me, you weren’t afraid of me.”
The Dragon’s voice was muffled and deep. Gu Fuyou didn’t quite catch what she said, asking, “What?”
“I need to change my clothes.”
“Ah? Okay.”
Realizing what was happening, Gu Fu You slowly turned around. The White Dragon transformed into a cloud and returned to her human form.
Gu Fuyou caught a glimpse from the corner of her eye of a black pattern trailing down from Zhong Michu’s porcelain-like shoulder, resembling a Dragon hidden within the mist. The pattern extended downward to her bosom.
A blush formed on Gu Fuyou’s face as she thought, so that’s where Senior Sister Zhong’s beast mark is.
Wiping her tears and straightening her hair, a thought struck her. “Senior Sister Zhong, do all Dragons need to take off their clothes before transforming?”
After a prolonged silence, Gu Fuyou couldn’t help but turn back. Zhong Michu, having dressed, was tying her hair. A blush on her usually cold face made her look extraordinarily charming and cute. “It’s my first transformation. I’m not very skilled.”
Indeed, she wasn’t. When she returned to human form, there were still white scales on her cheek, and a pair of broken horns on her forehead.
Looking at those horns, Gu Fuyou felt inexplicably upset.
Zhong Michu said, “Gu Fuyou, don’t mention to others that I’m from the Dragon clan.”
Being the daughter of Elder Yunran, why was Zhong Michu of the Dragon clan? Why was she raised in Xuan Miao Sect? Did the sect leader know her identity? Anyone could tell there was a mystery here.
But since Zhong Michu didn’t want others to know her identity, Gu Fuyou didn’t think much about it or ask further. She simply replied, “Okay.”
Observing Zhong Michu for a moment, Gu Fuyou noted that in her current state, she would attract too much attention.
Rummaging through her storage bag, she pulled out a hat with white veils and put it on Zhong Michu, laughing, “Now, no one will notice.”
As Zhong Michu touched the hat, Gu Fuyou quickly grabbed her arm and said with a smile, “Let’s leave this place now.”
To avoid curious people who saw the White Dragon.
Without waiting for Zhong Michu’s response, she led her out. Ah Fu was waiting outside and stood up wagging his tail upon seeing them.
The two of them and the beast left Moon Exit Pass and headed back to Wantong City.
